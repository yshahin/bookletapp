Proper paring transforms thick, stiff leather into supple material that wraps cleanly around boards and folds neatly at turn-ins.

**TL;DR**
- Edge paring creates thin, flexible turn-ins that lie flat under endpapers
- Broad paring reduces overall thickness for lighter, more elegant bindings
- Consistent technique matters more than expensive tools

## Why Pare Leather?

Binding leather comes thick enough for durability but too thick for bookwork:

**Problems with unpared leather:**
- Turn-ins create bulk at board edges
- Folds crack or won't lie flat
- Joints too stiff to flex
- Cover looks lumpy and unprofessional

**Paring solves these by:**
- Thinning edges for clean turn-ins
- Creating flexible fold areas
- Allowing sharp, clean edges
- Producing smooth, professional results

## Edge Paring

Edge paring thins only the edges of the leather, typically to a feathered edge.

#### Where to Edge Pare

**Turn-in areas:**
- All edges that will fold over board edges
- Head, tail, and fore edge turn-ins
- Corner areas (very thin for mitering)

**Overlap areas:**
- Where leather meets other materials
- Half-binding transitions
- Quarter-binding spine edges

#### The Feathered Edge

The goal is a gradual transition from full thickness to paper-thin:

```
Cross-section of edge:

Full thickness → Gradual thinning → Feather edge
════════════════════╲_______________
                                    Paper thin
```

**Width of pared area:** Typically 1-2 cm, depending on turn-in width


#### Edge Paring Technique

**Setup:**
1. Position leather flesh-side up on paring stone
2. Edge to be pared toward you
3. Knife sharp and ready

**The motion (French knife):**
1. Place blade on leather at start of paring zone
2. Low angle (nearly parallel to surface)
3. Push forward while pressing down
4. Blade shaves thin layer
5. Continue overlapping strokes
6. Gradually increase depth toward edge
7. Final edge should be paper-thin

**The motion (English knife):**
1. Blade enters leather at start of paring zone
2. Draw toward yourself
3. Controlled angle maintains consistent cut
4. Repeat, moving along edge
5. Build up feather gradually

#### Signs of Good Edge Paring

- Smooth, consistent thinning
- No gouges or cut-throughs
- Gradual transition (no steps)
- Edge flexible but not fragile
- Feels even across full length

## Full-Surface Paring

Full-surface (or overall) paring thins the entire piece of leather.

#### When to Full-Surface Pare

**Always for:**
- Onlays (decorative pieces glued on surface)
- Inlays (decorative pieces set into surface)
- Doublures (leather linings)

**Sometimes for:**
- Very thick leather
- Small books where any bulk shows
- Achieving specific flexibility

#### Full-Surface Technique

This is more demanding than edge paring:

**With knife:**
1. Work in systematic rows
2. Consistent angle and pressure
3. Overlapping strokes
4. Check thickness frequently
5. Very time-consuming

**With spokeshave:**
1. Adjust blade for shallow cut
2. Push or pull (depending on type)
3. Systematic rows
4. Faster than knife
5. Harder to achieve very thin results

**With machine (Scharf-Fix):**
1. Feed leather through
2. Preset thickness
3. Consistent results
4. Significant investment
5. Professional efficiency


#### Signs of Good Full-Surface Paring

- Even thickness throughout
- No thin spots or holes
- Surface smooth (not gouged)
- Consistent flexibility
- Maintained strength

## The Paring Stone

Your work surface matters:

**Ideal stone:**
- Marble slab (traditional)
- Thick glass plate
- Lithographic stone
- Smooth, hard, flat surface

**Size:** Large enough for your leather piece

**Care:**
- Keep clean (leather oils accumulate)
- Protect from chips
- Occasional cleaning with appropriate solvent

## Common Paring Problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cutting through | Angle too steep | Lower knife angle |
| Gouging | Knife catching | Sharper blade, better control |
| Uneven thickness | Inconsistent pressure | Practice, check frequently |
| Stepped surface | Strokes not overlapping | More overlap, blend strokes |
| Leather tearing | Dull blade or wrong direction | Sharpen, work with grain |
| Fatigue | Gripping too tight | Relax grip, take breaks |

## Practicing Paring

Before working on good leather:

**Practice exercises:**

1. **Simple edge:** Pare one edge to feather, check consistency
2. **All edges:** Pare a complete piece for turn-ins
3. **Controlled removal:** Pare to specific thickness (measure)
4. **Full surface (small):** Pare a palm-sized piece evenly

**Evaluate your work:**
- Feel for consistency
- Hold to light (thin spots show)
- Fold to test flexibility
- Measure with calipers

## Leather Considerations

Different leathers pare differently:

**Goatskin:**
- Excellent for paring
- Long fibers hold together
- Preferred for fine binding

**Calfskin:**
- Smooth, even paring
- More delicate than goat
- Requires care

**Sheepskin:**
- Softer, less durable
- Pares easily but tears easily
- Practice leather (inexpensive)

**Grain affects paring:**
- Work with the grain when possible
- Against grain catches more
- Observe fiber direction

## Checking Your Work

During paring, check frequently:

**Visual:**
- Hold leather to light
- Thin areas show through
- Look for consistency

**Tactile:**
- Feel with fingers
- Notice thick and thin spots
- Even flexibility throughout

**Measurement:**
- Use calipers for specific thickness
- Check multiple points
- Essential for critical work

## How Thin Is Thin Enough?

Depends on application:

**Turn-in edges:**
- Paper-thin (0.2-0.3mm)
- Should disappear under pastedown

**General paring:**
- Card thickness (0.5-0.7mm)
- Workable but with substance

**Full surface for overlays:**
- Very thin (0.3-0.4mm)
- Must conform to underlayer

## Safety Considerations

Paring involves extremely sharp tools:

**Protect yourself:**
- Never cut toward your body
- Keep fingers behind the blade
- Secure the leather
- Stay focused

**Protect your tools:**
- Store blades properly
- Don't drop (damages edge)
- Keep sharp (dull tools slip)

## Building Skill

Paring skill develops over time:

**The learning curve:**
- Expect early frustration
- Each piece teaches something
- Consistency comes with practice
- Speed comes last (after control)

**Realistic expectations:**
- First attempts will be uneven
- Progress is gradual
- Professional results take years
- Keep practicing

## When to Seek Help

Some situations benefit from professional work:

**Consider professional paring for:**
- Valuable projects
- Difficult leathers
- Large pieces requiring machine work
- When learning curve delays important project
