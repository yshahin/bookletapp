Quarter leather binding combines a leather spine with paper-covered boards for an elegant, accessible first leather project.

**TL;DR**
- Leather covers the spine only — paper or cloth covers the boards
- Requires less paring skill than full leather while teaching core techniques
- The leather-to-paper joint is the critical detail that makes or breaks the design

## Why Choose Quarter-Leather?

*   **Durability:** Leather provides superior strength at the joint compared to cloth or paper.
*   **Aesthetics:** The contrast between the leather spine and marbled paper sides is historically significant and visually striking.
*   **Cost:** It uses significantly less skin than a full binding.

## Key Techniques

#### 1. Leather Paring (The Hinge)
As discussed in our *Knife Sharpening Workshop*, the leather must be pared thin where it turns in at the head and tail, but also along the "joint" where the board opens.
*   **Spine Area:** Leave full thickness (or slightly thinned) for strength.
*   **Joint Area:** Pare to approximately 0.5-0.7mm to ensure the board opens freely.
*   **Turn-ins:** Pare to 0.3mm to avoid bulk at the headcaps.

#### 2. Board Attachment
Unlike case binding, quarter-leather bindings often use a "Split Board" or "Laced-on" structure where the boards are attached to the text block *before* covering.
*   **Split Boards:** A thick board and a thin board glued together, with a pocket left for the sewing tapes or waste sheet to be inserted.

#### 3. Covering the Spine
1.  **Paste Up:** Apply wheat starch paste to the leather. Let it soak to relax the fibers.
2.  **Mounting:** Center the leather on the spine.
3.  **Molding:** Use a bone folder to mold the leather over the spine bands (if present) and into the joints.
4.  **Tying Up:** Wrap cord around the book and over the joints to hold the leather tight while it dries.

#### 4. Siding Up
Once the leather is dry and trimmed, the paper or cloth sides are applied.
*   **Trim:** Cut the paper to overlap the leather by exactly 3-4mm.
*   **Glue:** Use PVA or a mix of PVA/Paste for the sides.
*   **Rub Down:** Ensure neat adhesion where the paper overlaps the leather.

## Troubleshooting
*   **Stiff Opening:** Usually caused by leather that wasn't pared thin enough at the hinge.
*   **Staining:** Paste can stain some leathers. Keep your hands and tools clean.

Mastering the quarter-binding teaches you the fundamental handling of leather before you move on to full-skin covers.
