Commercial book cloth delivers consistent results, but making your own opens creative possibilities and reduces costs.

**TL;DR**
- Back any tightly woven cotton or linen fabric with tissue paper using wheat paste
- Dry under weight for 24–48 hours before use
- Costs 50–70% less than commercial book cloth with unlimited pattern options

## Why Make Your Own Book Cloth

**Advantages:**
- Choose any fabric pattern or color
- Significant cost savings for large projects
- Customize weight and flexibility
- Use vintage or specialty fabrics
- Understand materials at a deeper level

**Considerations:**
- Requires drying time (24–48 hours)
- Workspace needs protection
- Results vary with experience
- Not all fabrics work well

## Understanding Book Cloth Structure

Commercial book cloth consists of:
1. **Fabric** — The visible outer layer
2. **Backing** — Paper layer that prevents glue strike-through
3. **Sizing/Coating** — Treatment for stability and adhesion

When making book cloth at home, you replicate this structure using:
1. **Your chosen fabric** — Cotton, linen, or similar
2. **Tissue paper** — Provides the backing
3. **Paste** — Bonds fabric to tissue and adds sizing

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Fabric | Tightly woven cotton or linen | Outer covering |
| Tissue paper | Acid-free, unbleached | Backing layer |
| Wheat paste | Home-cooked or purchased | Adhesive and sizing |
| Wax paper | Large sheets | Work surface protection |
| Pressing boards | Smooth, clean | Drying flat |
| Heavy weights | 10–20 lbs (5–10 kg) | Pressing during drying |
| Wide brush | 2–3 inches (5–8cm) | Paste application |
| Brayer (optional) | Rubber roller | Smoothing |

> **Budget option:** Use clean newsprint instead of acid-free tissue for practice batches. Switch to acid-free for archival projects.

## Choosing the Right Fabric

Not all fabrics make good book cloth. The ideal fabric:

### Weave Characteristics
- Tight, even weave
- No loose threads
- Minimal stretch
- Medium weight (not too thick or thin)

### Fiber Content
- 100% cotton (best for beginners)
- Linen (excellent but expensive)
- Cotton-linen blends
- Avoid synthetics (paste won't penetrate)

> **Common mistake:** Using polyester-blend fabrics. The paste won't bond properly, causing delamination.

### Pattern Considerations
- Solid colors are most versatile
- Small patterns work well
- Large patterns may not align across covers
- Check pattern regularity before purchasing

### Fabrics That Work Well
- Quilting cotton
- Shirting fabric
- Linen suiting
- Canvas (lighter weights)
- Osnaburg
- Muslin (doubled)

### Fabrics to Avoid
- Polyester blends
- Stretchy knits
- Velvet or pile fabrics
- Very loosely woven materials
- Silk (requires special techniques)

## Preparing the Paste

Wheat paste creates the best bond for DIY book cloth. You can purchase pre-made paste or cook your own.

### Homemade Wheat Paste Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1/4 cup wheat starch (or white flour)
- 1 cup (240ml) water

**Method:**
1. Mix starch with 1/4 cup (60ml) cold water to form slurry
2. Bring remaining 3/4 cup (180ml) water to boil
3. Slowly add slurry to boiling water, stirring constantly
4. Reduce heat and continue stirring until thickened (3–5 minutes)
5. Remove from heat
6. Strain through fine mesh to remove lumps
7. Cover surface with plastic wrap to prevent skin forming
8. Let cool to room temperature before use

**Consistency:** Should be like thick cream—spreadable but not runny.

> **Pro tip:** Cook paste the day before you need it. Overnight refrigeration gives a smoother, more consistent texture.

### Paste Adjustments

- **Too thick:** Add water, a tablespoon at a time
- **Too thin:** Cook longer next time; for current batch, let it sit (evaporation thickens)
- **Lumpy:** Strain through cheesecloth or blend briefly

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace

1. Cover your work surface with wax paper
2. Have all materials within reach
3. Prepare drying area with pressing boards
4. Work in a well-ventilated space
5. Protect clothing (paste washes out but is messy)

### Step 2: Prepare the Fabric

1. Wash and dry the fabric (removes sizing and preshrinks)
2. Press with iron to remove wrinkles
3. Cut to desired size plus 2-inch (5cm) margin on all sides
4. Cut tissue paper to match

### Step 3: Apply Paste to Tissue

1. Lay tissue paper on wax paper
2. Apply paste with brush in thin, even coat
3. Work from center outward
4. Cover entire surface
5. Paste should be visible but not pooling

**Technique tip:** Use X strokes—diagonal passes ensure complete coverage.

![Step 2: Applying paste to tissue paper with brush](/images/diagrams/paste-application-book-cloth.jpg)

### Step 4: Position the Fabric

1. Lay fabric right-side up
2. Carefully lower pasted tissue onto fabric back
3. Align edges as well as possible
4. Press down gently from center

### Step 5: Remove Air Bubbles

1. Use brayer or bone folder wrapped in cloth
2. Roll from center toward edges
3. Work systematically in all directions
4. Excess paste should squeeze out at edges

> **Tool swap:** No brayer? A clean glass jar or rolling pin wrapped in cloth works similarly.

### Step 6: Apply Paste to Fabric Surface

This step sizes the fabric for better adhesion later:

1. Flip the book cloth over (fabric side up)
2. Apply thin paste coat to fabric surface
3. Work paste into the weave
4. Wipe off excess with clean cloth
5. This seals the fabric and aids future gluing

### Step 7: Drying

1. Place book cloth between sheets of clean newsprint or blotter paper
2. Place between pressing boards
3. Add weights—10–20 lbs (5–10 kg)
4. Change blotter paper after first hour
5. Dry for 24–48 hours
6. Check for complete dryness before storing

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Air bubbles | Incomplete smoothing | More thorough brayer work |
| Wrinkles | Fabric shifted during application | Work more carefully; trim affected areas |
| Paste strike-through | Too much paste or thin fabric | Use less paste; double the tissue |
| Delamination | Insufficient paste | Ensure complete coverage |
| Stiff result | Too much paste | Use thinner paste layer |
| Warping | Uneven drying | Better pressing, change blotters frequently |
| Color bleeding | Fabric not colorfast | Pre-wash and test fabric first |

## Testing Your Book Cloth

Before using on a real project, test your homemade book cloth:

**Flexibility test:**
- Fold a corner—should bend without cracking
- Crease with bone folder—should hold sharp fold
- Unfold—should not delaminate

**Adhesion test:**
- Glue a small piece to scrap board
- Let dry completely
- Try to peel off—should resist separation
- PVA should absorb without bleeding through

**Durability test:**
- Rub surface with dry finger—should not pill
- Scratch gently with fingernail—should not mark easily

## Alternative Methods

### Using PVA Instead of Paste

Some bookbinders prefer PVA for making book cloth:

**Advantages:**
- Faster drying
- Stronger initial bond
- Available pre-made

**Disadvantages:**
- Less flexible result
- Irreversible (conservation concern)
- Can soak through fabric more readily

**Method adjustment:** Dilute PVA 2:1 with water and apply sparingly.

### Heat-Set Method

For very delicate fabrics:

1. Use heat-activated adhesive film
2. Iron fabric to tissue through adhesive
3. No wet paste involved
4. Good for silk or delicate vintage fabrics
5. Requires special materials

## Storage and Shelf Life

**Storing finished book cloth:**
- Roll around a cardboard tube (fabric side out)
- Or store flat between acid-free tissue
- Keep in cool, dry location
- Label with fabric type and date made
- Use within 1 year for best results

**Storing leftover paste:**
- Refrigerate in airtight container
- Use within 1 week
- Discard if mold appears or smell changes

## Cost Comparison

Making your own book cloth offers significant savings:

| Material | Commercial Cost | DIY Cost | Savings |
|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| 1 yard solid cotton | $25–40/yard | $8–15/yard | 60–70% |
| 1 yard linen | $50–80/yard | $20–35/yard | 50–60% |
| 1 yard patterned | $30–50/yard | $10–20/yard | 50–70% |

**Note:** DIY costs include fabric, tissue, and paste materials.

## Creative Applications

Homemade book cloth allows unique possibilities:

**Custom patterns:**
- Print designs on fabric before backing
- Use batik or hand-dyed fabrics
- Create matching sets with coordinated patterns

**Vintage materials:**
- Repurpose antique linens
- Use meaningful textiles (grandmother's apron, etc.)
- Create memory books with family fabrics

**Mixed media:**
- Incorporate decorative papers into fabric
- Create collaged covering materials
- Experiment with non-traditional bases

## FAQ

**Can I use any cotton fabric?**
It needs to be tightly woven with minimal stretch. Quilting cotton and shirting fabrics work well. Avoid knits, loose weaves, or stretchy materials.

**Why does my book cloth curl after drying?**
Uneven paste application or inadequate pressing during drying. Ensure complete paste coverage and use sufficient weight.

**How long does homemade book cloth last?**
Properly stored (rolled or flat, cool and dry), it lasts at least a year. Very old book cloth may become brittle.

**Can I iron my book cloth?**
Yes, on the tissue side with low heat. This can help flatten slight warps. Don't iron directly on the fabric side—you may create shine.

**What if paste bleeds through the fabric?**
You used too much paste or the fabric is too open-weave. For current piece, wipe off excess immediately. For future batches, use thinner paste layers or tighter-weave fabric.
