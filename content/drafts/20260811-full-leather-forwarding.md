Full leather forwarding covers the entire book in leather, requiring advanced paring and precise covering technique.

**TL;DR**
- Leather must be pared to varying thicknesses across different zones
- Covering requires working quickly while paste remains tacky
- Corner treatment and turn-ins define the quality of the finished binding

## The Structure: Raised Bands

Unlike modern "hollow back" books, traditional leather bindings are often "tight backs" sewn on **raised cords**.
*   The texture of the spine is defined by the thick hemp cords the book is sewn onto.
*   The leather is pasted directly to the spine and molded over these cords, creating the classic "ribbed" look.

## Lacing In

The connection between the book and cover is mechanical, not just adhesive.
1.  **Fraying:** The ends of the sewing cords (slips) are frayed out into soft fibers.
2.  **Holing:** Holes are punched into the binder's board.
3.  **Lacing:** The frayed slips are threaded through the boards and hammered flat.
This makes it nearly impossible for the covers to be torn off.

## Covering Process

Covering a full leather book is a time-sensitive race against the drying paste.

1.  **Paring:** The entire skin must be shaved to the correct thickness, with edges feather-pared to near zero.
2.  **Pasting:** The skin is thoroughly soaked with paste. It becomes cool, clammy, and stretchy.
3.  **Drawing On:** The skin is draped over the book.
4.  **The Headcaps:** The leather at the head and tail is shaped over the endbands. This is the mark of a master—a well-formed headcap is smooth and protective.
5.  **The Corners:** Unlike cloth, leather corners are "mitered" (cut at 45 degrees) and formed by butt-joining the edges of the leather, rather than overlapping.

## Why It Matters

A full leather binding, when engineered correctly with good "forwarding" (structure), functions as a precise machine. The heavy boards provide leverage to open the book, the tight spine throws the pages upward for reading, and the leather acts as a tough, flexible hinge that can last for 500 years or more.
