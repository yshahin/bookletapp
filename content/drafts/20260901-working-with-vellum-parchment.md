Vellum and parchment are animal-skin materials with unique properties that require specific handling techniques for successful bookbinding.

**TL;DR**
- Vellum (calfskin) and parchment (sheep/goat) respond dramatically to humidity
- Conditioning and restraining during drying prevents warping and cockling
- Always work in moderate humidity and allow time for the material to acclimate

## Understanding the Material

Vellum and parchment are prepared animal skins, not leather:

**Difference from leather:**
- Leather is tanned (chemically treated)
- Vellum/parchment is prepared without tanning
- Skin is limed, scraped, and dried under tension
- Structure remains reactive to moisture

**Historical distinction:**
- Vellum: Originally from calf (vitulus = calf)
- Parchment: From sheep or goat
- Today, terms often used interchangeably

**Modern sources:**
- Calf vellum (finest, most expensive)
- Goat parchment (common, good quality)
- Sheep parchment (more economical)
- Modern alternatives (paper-based products)


## Properties You Must Understand

#### Humidity Sensitivity

The defining characteristic:

**When humidity increases:**
- Skin absorbs moisture
- Material expands
- Relaxes and becomes limp
- May cockle (become wavy)

**When humidity decreases:**
- Skin releases moisture
- Material contracts
- Becomes stiff
- Can warp or distort if restrained

**This is permanent:** Vellum will always respond to humidity changes.

#### Dimensional Movement

Movement is not uniform:
- Greater across the skin than along the spine (backbone)
- Flesh side more reactive than hair side
- Edges more reactive than center
- Thin areas more reactive than thick

#### Tension Memory

Vellum "remembers" how it was dried:
- Pulled tight during manufacture
- Wants to return to that state
- Curls toward hair side in dry conditions
- Flattens or reverses in humid conditions

## Selecting Vellum

When purchasing vellum, consider:

#### Quality Indicators

**Good vellum:**
- Uniform thickness
- Even translucency
- No holes or thin spots
- Smooth surface
- Pleasant creamy color

**Avoid:**
- Obvious veins or marks
- Very thin or thick patches
- Stiff or brittle feel
- Discolored areas
- Visible hair follicles (unless desired)

#### Thickness Grades

| Grade | Thickness | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Manuscript | 0.1-0.15mm | Writing, painting |
| Medium | 0.2-0.3mm | Covers, fine binding |
| Heavy | 0.3-0.5mm | Structural use |

For limp binding covers, medium weight works best.

## Preparing to Work

#### Environment Control

Your workspace humidity matters:

**Ideal conditions:**
- 50-55% relative humidity
- Stable (no rapid changes)
- Moderate temperature
- Good air circulation

**Problems from extremes:**
- Too dry: Vellum stiff, may crack
- Too humid: Vellum limp, hard to control
- Variable: Constant movement, frustration

#### Conditioning the Vellum

Before cutting or folding:

1. Remove from storage
2. Allow to acclimate to workspace (several hours)
3. Check flexibility and response
4. Condition further if needed

**Slight humidification:**
- Place between slightly damp blotters
- Check every 15-30 minutes
- Goal: Supple but not wet
- Never soak or wet directly

## Cutting Vellum

#### Tools

- Very sharp knife (sharper than for paper)
- Metal straight edge
- Cutting mat
- Clean hands (oils affect vellum)

#### Technique

1. Mark cutting lines on flesh side (pencil)
2. Secure vellum flat
3. Multiple light passes, not one heavy cut
4. Cut slightly oversize initially
5. Trim to exact size when ready to use

**Critical:** Dull knives tear vellum. Test sharpness before starting.

## Folding Vellum

Vellum doesn't fold like paper:

#### Scoring

Always score before folding:
1. Use bone folder firmly
2. Score on flesh side
3. Fold forms toward hair side
4. Creates clean fold without cracking

#### The Fold

1. Score line established
2. Dampen slightly along fold if needed
3. Fold carefully, aligning edges
4. Press with bone folder
5. Don't over-burnish (can polish surface)

**Vellum creases hold:** Unlike paper, vellum folds are more permanent.


## Attaching Vellum

#### Adhesive Choices

**Paste (wheat or rice):**
- Traditional choice
- Allows repositioning
- Compatible with skin material
- Long working time

**Methyl cellulose:**
- Conservation standard
- Very reversible
- Light tack
- Good for delicate work

**PVA:**
- Stronger bond
- Less reversible
- Can cause cockling
- Use sparingly if at all

#### Application

1. Apply adhesive to vellum (not to board)
2. Work from center outward
3. Position carefully
4. Smooth immediately
5. Press under weight while drying

**Drying time:** Longer than paper - vellum must equalize with adhesive moisture.

## Vellum as Book Covering

For limp vellum covers:

#### Cutting the Cover

1. Measure wrapped dimension
2. Add overlap for turn-ins or tuck-ins
3. Cut with grain running head to tail
4. Allow extra for trimming

#### Attaching to Text Block

Options:

**Long stitch through cover:**
- Sew signatures directly through vellum
- Traditional, strong
- Visible sewing on spine

**Separate attachment:**
- Text block sewn independently
- Cover wrapped and attached
- More refined appearance

**Laced-on cords:**
- Sewing supports lace through cover
- Historical accuracy
- Strong connection

## Dealing with Cockling

Cockling (waviness) is the main challenge:

#### Prevention

- Control humidity in workspace
- Don't over-wet during preparation
- Allow adequate drying time
- Press firmly during drying

#### If Cockling Occurs

1. Lightly humidify the vellum
2. Place between blotters
3. Press under weight
4. Dry slowly
5. May need to repeat

**Important:** Cockling may return with humidity changes - it's the nature of the material.

## Decorating Vellum

#### Gold Tooling

Vellum accepts gold tooling:
- Requires glair (egg white) preparation
- Lower temperature than on leather
- Delicate pressure
- Traditional for fine binding

#### Painting

Vellum was the manuscript painting surface:
- Accepts watercolor and gouache
- Size surface if ink is used
- Historical connection to illumination

#### Titling

- Can be tooled like leather
- Ink can be applied
- Printed labels can be attached
- Consider humidity effects

## Storage and Care

#### Storing Unused Vellum

- Flat, between acid-free tissue
- Stable humidity environment
- Away from direct light
- Not in plastic (traps moisture)

#### Caring for Vellum Books

- Store upright or flat
- Moderate humidity
- Handle with clean, dry hands
- Allow acclimation when moving between environments

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Vellum too stiff | Too dry | Light humidification |
| Vellum too limp | Too humid | Allow to dry in controlled environment |
| Cracking at fold | Insufficient scoring or too dry | Score more, slight dampening |
| Cockling after attachment | Excess moisture from adhesive | Less adhesive, longer drying |
| Adhesive won't stick | Surface too dry or smooth | Light dampening, roughen slightly |
| Color changes | Wrong adhesive or contamination | Use appropriate adhesive |

## Modern Alternatives

If vellum's challenges are too great:

**Japanese papers:**
- Similar translucency
- More stable
- Easier to work
- Different aesthetic

**Vegetable parchment:**
- Paper processed to resemble vellum
- Stable
- Affordable
- Not the same material

**Synthetic vellum:**
- Plastic-based products
- Very stable
- Modern appearance
- No natural character
