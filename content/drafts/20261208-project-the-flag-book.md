The flag book features pages that swing open from an accordion spine, creating a playful, interactive reading experience.

**TL;DR**
- Pages ("flags") attach to the peaks and valleys of an accordion spine
- Opening the accordion causes pages to fan outward in alternating directions
- Great for visual storytelling, art installations, and creative gifts

## Understanding the Structure

The flag book consists of:
- An accordion spine
- Flags (pages) attached to the accordion
- When accordion opens, flags pop up
- Creates three-dimensional display

```
Closed:           Open (from above):
┌─────────┐
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │         │ │ │ │ │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │      ──┼─┼─┼─┼─┼──
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │         │ │ │ │ │
└─────────┘         (flags standing)
```

When the accordion extends, flags stand perpendicular, creating a sculptural display.


## Project Overview

**Structure:** Flag book (Hedi Kyle style)
**Finished size:** 4" x 6" closed

**Time required:** 2-3 hours
**Skill level:** Intermediate

## Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Accordion paper | Medium weight, 4" wide x 36" long | 1 strip |
| Flag paper | Card stock or text weight | 8 pieces, approximately 3.5" x 5" |
| Cover boards | Book board or matboard | 2 pieces, 4.25" x 6.25" |
| Cover paper | Decorative | For covering boards |
| PVA glue | As needed | - |
| Bone folder | Standard | - |
| Ruler and knife | For cutting | - |

## Understanding the Components

#### The Accordion Spine

The accordion forms the book's structure:
- Valley folds and mountain folds alternate
- Flags attach to valley folds
- Creates the mechanism for flag movement

#### The Flags

Flags are the "pages":
- Attach at their center to accordion valleys
- Fold flat when accordion is compressed
- Stand up when accordion extends

## Step-by-Step Construction

#### Step 1: Create the Accordion

1. Cut paper strip 4" wide x 36" long
2. Mark folds every 1.5" (creates 24 panels)
3. Score at each mark
4. Fold accordion: valley, mountain, valley, mountain...
5. Press sharp folds
6. You need an even number of panels

**Important:** Consistent fold width is essential.


#### Step 2: Prepare the Flags

Each flag gets folded in half:

1. Cut 8 rectangles, approximately 3.5" x 5"
2. Fold each in half to 3.5" x 2.5"
3. Crease firmly
4. These will straddle the accordion valleys

**Content considerations:**
- Design both sides if flags will show both
- Images should orient correctly when standing
- Test orientation before committing

#### Step 3: Plan Flag Placement

Flags attach to alternating valley folds:

```
Valley   Mountain   Valley   Mountain   Valley
  ↓                   ↓                   ↓
──┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──
  │                   │                   │
Flag 1              Flag 2              Flag 3
```

**Layout:**
- Skip the first panel (attaches to cover)
- Place flags at every second valley
- Alternate which side flags face
- Creates balanced display

#### Step 4: Attach Flags

For each flag:

1. Apply glue to outside of flag fold
2. Straddle accordion at valley fold
3. Flag fold sits in valley
4. Press firmly
5. Ensure flag is perpendicular to accordion
6. Allow to dry before moving to next

**Alternating sides:**
- First flag: folds toward front
- Second flag: folds toward back
- Continue alternating
- Creates visual interest when open


#### Step 5: Test the Mechanism

Before adding covers:

1. Gently extend accordion
2. Flags should stand up
3. Compress accordion
4. Flags should fold down
5. Check that nothing sticks or binds

**Adjustments:**
- If flags stick, reduce glue at attachment
- If flags flop, ensure attachment is secure
- All flags should move smoothly

#### Step 6: Create Covers

Covers attach to first and last accordion panels:

1. Cut two boards slightly larger than accordion width
2. Cover boards with decorative paper
3. Turn edges
4. Interior will be finished by accordion attachment

#### Step 7: Attach Accordion to Covers

1. Apply glue to first accordion panel
2. Adhere to inside of front cover
3. Position for even margins
4. Apply glue to last accordion panel
5. Adhere to inside of back cover
6. Ensure accordion folds freely between covers

## Making It Work

#### Opening the Flag Book

1. Hold covers
2. Pull apart gently
3. Accordion extends
4. Flags pop up
5. Can display in extended position

#### Closing

1. Push covers together
2. Flags fold flat
3. Book closes to standard shape
4. Can stand on shelf

## Design Variations

#### More Flags

Increasing complexity:
- More accordion panels
- More flag positions
- More dramatic extended display

#### Different Flag Sizes

Variety in flags:
- Varied heights create visual rhythm
- Different widths for emphasis
- Mixed sizes for organic feel

#### Shaped Flags

Beyond rectangles:
- Cut flags into shapes
- Silhouettes and figures
- Architectural elements
- Plant forms

#### Pop-Up Elements on Flags

Adding dimension:
- Simple pop-ups attached to flags
- Creates secondary motion
- Complex but engaging

## Content Ideas

The flag book suits specific content:

**Visual narratives:**
- Sequential images
- Story scenes
- Before/after comparisons

**Collected images:**
- Photo collections
- Art reproductions
- Botanical illustrations

**Text and image:**
- Poetry with illustration
- Quotes with graphics
- Multilingual text

**Abstract:**
- Color studies
- Pattern collections
- Texture explorations

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Flags don't stand | Attachment too weak | Reglue securely |
| Flags stick together | Glue on wrong surfaces | More careful glue application |
| Accordion won't close | Flags too long | Trim flag height |
| Uneven display | Inconsistent attachment angles | Re-attach for perpendicular |
| Book won't stay closed | Flags springing | May need tie or elastic closure |

## Historical Context

Hedi Kyle (b. 1937) developed the flag book structure as part of her innovative book arts practice. Kyle's work emphasizes the book as a three-dimensional object with movement and surprise. The flag book demonstrates that the codex form contains unexplored possibilities.

Kyle's structures have influenced generations of book artists and continue to be taught in programs worldwide.

## Taking It Further

After mastering the basic flag book:

**Dos-a-dos flag book:**
- Two flag books back to back
- Opens from both sides

**Tunnel flag book:**
- Flags create layered viewing
- Foreground to background depth

**Circular flag book:**
- Accordion forms a circle
- Flags radiate outward

## Teaching with Flag Books

Flag books work well for workshops:
- Clear mechanism to understand
- Room for personal expression
- Satisfying results quickly
- Introduces sculptural book concepts
