Mending torn pages with Japanese tissue and wheat paste creates nearly invisible repairs that restore both strength and readability.

**TL;DR**
- Japanese tissue torn (not cut) to shape creates feathered edges that blend invisibly
- Wheat paste allows repositioning and dries to a flexible, archival bond
- Always mend from the back of the page to minimize visual impact on text

## Understanding Paper Mending

Effective mending requires understanding:
- The nature of paper tears
- How adhesives interact with paper
- Why some repairs fail
- What makes repairs archival

**Goals of good mending:**
- Stabilize the damage
- Restore function
- Preserve appearance
- Remain reversible
- Last as long as the original


## Why Japanese Tissue?

Japanese tissue (particularly kozo - mulberry fiber) is ideal for mending:

**Properties:**
- Long, strong fibers
- Very thin yet durable
- Translucent (less visible)
- Compatible with Western paper
- Archival quality

**Comparison to alternatives:**

| Material | Strength | Visibility | Archival | Reversible |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|------------|
| Japanese tissue | Excellent | Low | Yes | Yes |
| Transparent tape | Good | High | No | No |
| Office paper | Poor | High | Variable | Difficult |
| Heat-set tissue | Good | Medium | Yes | Difficult |

## Materials for Mending

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Japanese tissue | Kozo, 8-12 gsm | Thin but strong |
| Wheat paste | Archival | Primary adhesive |
| Small brushes | Various sizes | For paste application |
| Silicone release paper | Polyester web | Prevents sticking |
| Weights | For pressing | Clean, smooth |
| Water container | Clean | For brush rinsing |
| Bone folder | Rounded | For smoothing |

## Types of Paper Damage

Different damage requires different approaches:

#### Clean Tears

Paper torn along a line but pieces fit together:
- Easiest to mend
- Pieces align well
- Minimal fill needed

#### Losses

Paper actually missing:
- Cannot align edges
- May need fill material
- More complex repair

#### Multiple Fragments

Many small pieces:
- Requires patience
- Systematic reassembly
- Consider overall approach first

#### Edge Tears

Damage at margins:
- Common from handling
- Often reinforced rather than mended
- Less critical unless affecting text

## Preparing Japanese Tissue

#### Selecting Weight

- 8-10 gsm: General mending
- 12-15 gsm: Spine repairs, more strength needed
- 5-7 gsm: Delicate papers, minimal visible mend

#### Tearing vs. Cutting

**Tear** rather than cut tissue for mending:

1. Dampen line where tear is wanted
2. Pull gently along dampened line
3. Creates feathered edge
4. Feathered edge blends better than cut edge

**Why tearing works:**
- Fibers extend beyond edge
- Transition is gradual
- Less visible when adhered


## Preparing Wheat Paste

**For mending consistency:**
- Slightly thinner than for cloth work
- Should flow smoothly from brush
- Not so thin it soaks through instantly

**Storage:**
- Fresh paste is best
- Can refrigerate for short-term use
- No lumps

## Basic Mending Technique

#### Step 1: Assess the Tear

1. Identify all fragments
2. Determine how they fit together
3. Check if all pieces are present
4. Plan your approach

#### Step 2: Prepare Work Surface

1. Place page on clean surface
2. Protect underlying pages with release paper
3. Have all materials ready
4. Good lighting essential

#### Step 3: Align Tear Edges

1. Position torn pieces together
2. Match fibers at tear edge
3. Slight overlap at tear line is acceptable
4. Ensure text/images align properly

#### Step 4: Prepare Tissue Strip

1. Tear a strip of Japanese tissue
2. Width: Covers tear plus 3-5mm on each side
3. Length: Slightly longer than tear
4. Keep both sides of tissue available (verso may need matching strip)

#### Step 5: Apply Paste

1. Place tissue strip on waste paper
2. Apply thin, even coat of paste
3. Work from center to edges
4. Paste should saturate tissue

#### Step 6: Position Tissue

1. Carefully lift pasted tissue
2. Position over aligned tear
3. Center over the tear line
4. Lay down gently

#### Step 7: Smooth and Dry

1. Cover with silicone release paper
2. Smooth with bone folder through the paper
3. Work out air bubbles and excess paste
4. Remove release paper
5. Allow to dry under light weight


## Mending from Both Sides

For stronger repairs or fragile paper:

1. Complete mend on one side
2. Allow to dry completely
3. Turn over
4. Apply matching strip to other side
5. Align tissue strips
6. Dry under weight

## Special Situations

#### Tears Extending into Text

When text crosses the tear:

1. Extra care aligning pieces
2. Use thinnest possible tissue
3. Consider mending from verso only
4. Text remains readable through tissue

#### Tears at Spine Edge

For gutters and spine margins:

1. May need to reinforce rather than mend
2. Guard (strip along spine) may be appropriate
3. Consider book's structure
4. Don't create bulk that affects opening

#### Multiple Tears on One Page

For extensively damaged pages:

1. Mend largest tears first
2. Stabilize structure
3. Then address smaller tears
4. Consider overall strengthening vs. individual mends

## Handling Paste-Ups and Mends

After mending:

**Drying:**
- Between silicone release papers
- Under light weight
- Several hours minimum

**Checking:**
- Verify tissue adhered completely
- No bubbles or lifting
- Text legible through mend

## When NOT to Mend

Some situations require different approaches:

**Very fragile paper:**
- Mending may cause more damage
- Consider encapsulation
- Consult conservator

**Valuable or rare books:**
- Professional conservation recommended
- Documentation important
- Provenance considerations

**Paper so damaged mending is insufficient:**
- May need washing and resizing
- Beyond basic mending scope
- Specialized treatment required

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Prevention |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Too much paste | Wrinkles, staining | Thin application |
| Tissue too thick | Visible, stiff | Choose appropriate weight |
| Cut edges | Visible line | Always tear tissue |
| Pieces misaligned | Text doesn't match | Careful positioning |
| Insufficient drying | Mold risk, sticking | Complete drying time |
| Mending across opening | Restricts page turn | Plan for book function |

## Quality Checklist

After mending, verify:

- [ ] Tear edges aligned properly
- [ ] Tissue fully adhered (no bubbles)
- [ ] Mend lies flat
- [ ] Text legible through tissue
- [ ] Page turns freely
- [ ] No excess paste visible
- [ ] Appearance acceptable

## Practice Recommendations

Before working on valuable books:

**Practice tears:**
1. Damage scrap paper intentionally
2. Practice aligning edges
3. Perfect tissue tearing technique
4. Develop paste application skill

**Build confidence:**
- Start with less visible tears
- Progress to more critical repairs
- Each mend teaches lessons
