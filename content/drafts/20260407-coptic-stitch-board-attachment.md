Building on the basics covered in Part 1, this article focuses on the nuances of board attachment in Coptic binding.

**TL;DR**
- Three-hole attachment distributes stress better than basic wrap-around
- Consistent tension throughout sewing creates professional results
- Pre-cover boards with decorative paper before sewing for finished appearance

## Board Attachment Options

Coptic binding allows several methods for attaching covers. Each affects the book's appearance and function.

### Method 1: Wrap-Around (Basic)

The method covered in Part 1:
- Thread wraps around board edge
- Enters and exits same hole twice
- Creates small thread wrap visible on spine edge

**Pros:** Simple, secure, traditional
**Cons:** Thread shows on cover edge

### Method 2: Three-Hole Attachment

For each sewing station, punch three holes in the cover:
- Main hole (same position as basic method)
- Two additional holes behind the main hole
- Thread weaves through all three

```
  Spine edge
      │
      │    • Main hole (aligned with signatures)
      │    • Support hole (inward)
      │    • Support hole (inward)
      │
```

**Sewing path:**
1. Exit signature at station
2. Enter main hole from outside
3. Exit support hole 1
4. Enter support hole 2
5. Exit main hole
6. Continue chain pattern

**Pros:** More secure, distributes stress
**Cons:** More holes to punch, slower

> **Pro tip:** Space the three holes about 1/4 inch (6mm) apart in a row perpendicular to the spine edge.

### Method 3: Paired Holes

Two holes per station, side by side:

```
  Spine edge
      │
      │    • •  ← Paired holes
      │
```

**Sewing path:**
1. Exit signature
2. Enter first hole from outside
3. Exit second hole
4. Continue to next station or signature

**Pros:** Clean appearance, very secure
**Cons:** More punching, requires careful alignment

### Method 4: Long Stitch Variant

Cover holes extend along the spine edge, creating decorative long stitches:

**Pros:** Decorative spine pattern
**Cons:** Less traditional Coptic appearance

## Choosing Board Materials

The cover boards you choose affect both sewing and final appearance.

### Book Board (Davey Board)

- Dense, heavy material
- Holds holes well
- Professional weight
- Standard for fine binding

**Thickness recommendations:**
- Small books (under 5 inches / 13cm): 1/32–1/16 inch (1–1.5mm)
- Medium books: 1/16–3/32 inch (2–2.5mm)
- Large books: 1/8 inch (3mm+)

### Chipboard

- Lighter weight
- More economical
- Adequate for journals
- Softer—holes may wear

> **Budget option:** Chipboard works well for practice and gift books. For durability, consider covering both sides with paper.

### Wood Veneer

- Interesting aesthetic
- Can be laser cut
- Holds holes well
- Heavier, different feel

### Leather-Covered Boards

- Cover boards first, then punch and sew
- Leather adds some thickness
- Very professional appearance
- Pre-covering essential

## Pre-Covering Boards

For finished appearance, cover boards before sewing:

### Process

1. Cut boards to final size
2. Mark hole positions clearly (will need to find after covering)
3. Cut covering material 3/4 inch (20mm) larger on all sides
4. Apply adhesive to board
5. Position covering material
6. Turn edges, miter corners
7. Press until dry
8. Locate and pierce holes through covering

> **Common mistake:** Not marking hole positions before covering. Use a pin to mark through from the inside, or measure carefully after covering.

### Tips for Pre-Covered Boards

- Mark hole positions on both sides of board
- Use awl carefully through covering
- Don't enlarge holes excessively
- Consider lining interior after sewing

## Tension Control

Consistent tension throughout sewing creates professional results. Variations cause problems.

### Understanding Tension Variables

**Thread tension:** How tight you pull after each stitch
**Signature tension:** How tightly signatures compress against each other
**Chain tension:** How tight the visible chain stitches appear

All three should be consistent throughout the book.

### Achieving Consistent Thread Tension

**Technique:**
1. Complete each stitch
2. Pull thread until snug (not tight)
3. Hold tension while starting next stitch
4. Don't release until needle has entered next hole

**Practice exercise:**
- Sew a practice book
- Count to three while pulling each stitch
- The count creates consistent pull duration

### Signature-to-Signature Consistency

Each signature should compress equally against the previous:

**Method:**
1. After linking each chain, press the new signature down
2. Use non-dominant thumb to hold in place
3. Maintain this pressure while entering next hole
4. Signature stays in position

**Visual check:**
- Spine should appear uniform
- No signature should stick out further than others
- Chain links should be equal length throughout

> **Pro tip:** If your first few signatures are looser than later ones (common beginner pattern), consciously ease up on tension as you progress.

### Chain Link Consistency

The decorative chain should look uniform:

**Technique:**
1. Same wrap direction every time
2. Same entry angle for the link
3. Same pull tension after forming link
4. Pause briefly to inspect each link

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Loose first signatures, tight last | Natural tendency to tighten | Consciously maintain looseness |
| Spine curves inward | Over-tensioning | Reduce pull force |
| Gaps between signatures | Under-tensioning | Increase pull and press signatures together |
| Wavy chain | Inconsistent link tension | Practice with scrap |
| Cover not flush with signatures | Cover holes misaligned | Verify alignment before sewing |

## Advanced Cover Attachment: Flush Spine

For covers that sit flush with the text block spine:

### Adjusting Hole Position

Move cover holes slightly closer to spine edge than signature holes:
- Signature stations: 3/8 inch (10mm) from fold
- Cover holes: 5/16 inch (8mm) from edge

This small difference allows the thread to pull covers flush with signatures.

### The "Wrap-In" Technique

1. Sew normally to last signature
2. At cover, enter from inside
3. Wrap around edge from outside to inside
4. Continue pattern

This reverses the normal wrap direction, pulling the cover inward.

## Cover Gap Management

Sometimes a small gap exists between cover and first/last signature. This is normal but can be minimized.

### Reducing Cover Gap

1. **Thinner thread at covers:** Use thinner thread for cover attachment only
2. **Tighter cover stitches:** Increase tension specifically at cover
3. **Pre-press:** Compress signatures before adding cover
4. **Adjusted hole positions:** Bring cover holes slightly closer to signatures

> **Tool swap:** If you're struggling with tension consistency, try a slightly heavier thread. Thicker thread is more forgiving of slight variations.

## Endsheet Options

Coptic binding doesn't require endsheets, but they can be added:

### Tipped-In Endsheets

1. Cut endsheet to signature size
2. Apply thin line of paste to fold edge
3. Adhere to first/last signature outer leaf
4. Becomes first/last page of book

### Sewn-In Endsheets

1. Add endsheet as part of first/last signature
2. Different paper creates visual distinction
3. Requires planning before sewing

### Wraparound Endsheets

1. Single folded sheet wraps around first/last signature
2. Creates continuous endsheet effect
3. More complex but elegant

## Professional Finishing Touches

### Interior Cover Lining

After sewing, line the inside covers:
1. Cut paper slightly smaller than cover—about 1/8 inch (3mm) margin on all sides
2. Apply paste
3. Position to cover thread ends
4. Press until dry

**Materials:** Decorative paper, marbled paper, or matching text paper

### Spine Finishing

Some binders add elements to the exposed spine:

- **Headbands:** Decorative threads at head and tail (non-functional in Coptic)
- **Beads:** Thread beads onto chain stitches
- **Ribbons:** Integrate ribbon markers during sewing

### Corner Treatment

For pre-covered boards:
1. Round corners with corner rounder
2. Reduces wear on corner covering
3. More refined appearance

## Comparing Attachment Methods

| Method | Difficulty | Appearance | Strength | Best For |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Basic wrap | Easy | Traditional | Good | Beginners, quick projects |
| Three-hole | Medium | Clean | Excellent | Archival work, frequent use |
| Paired holes | Medium | Modern | Excellent | Design-forward books |
| Long stitch variant | Advanced | Decorative | Good | Art books, display pieces |

## When Coptic Is the Right Choice

Coptic binding excels for:
- Journals and sketchbooks (lies flat)
- Recipe books (opens completely)
- Art books (dramatic spine display)
- Handmade gifts (visible craftsmanship)

Consider other structures for:
- Books needing spine titles (no flat spine)
- Very thick books (chain becomes bulky)
- Books stored spine-out (exposed stitching catches)

## FAQ

**Which attachment method is strongest?**
Three-hole and paired-hole methods distribute stress across multiple points, making them stronger than basic wrap-around. For heavy-use journals, choose one of these.

**Can I mix attachment methods in one book?**
Yes, though visual consistency usually works better. Some binders use stronger attachment at covers and simpler methods mid-book.

**How do I fix inconsistent tension after finishing?**
Unfortunately, tension cannot be corrected after sewing. This is why practice books are valuable—learn the feel before committing to good materials.

**Should I always pre-cover boards?**
For finished work, yes. For practice or rustic aesthetic, bare boards work fine. Consider your intended use and audience.

**Why does my spine curve?**
Over-tensioning pulls signatures together unevenly. Practice with deliberate, moderate tension and press the book under weight after completion.
