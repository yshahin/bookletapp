Sewing onto tapes creates strong, durable text blocks suitable for heavy books and archival binding.

**TL;DR**
- Tapes provide structural support and anchor text blocks to boards
- A sewing frame holds tapes taut at consistent positions while you work
- Thread wraps around tapes at each sewing station, creating very strong joints

## Understanding Tape Sewing

Tape sewing differs from unsupported sewing:

**With tapes:**
- Tapes provide structural support
- Thread wraps around tapes
- Tapes later anchor to boards
- Very strong, opens well

**Without tapes:**
- Thread carries full load
- Simpler but less strong
- Suitable for lighter books

<!-- TODO: Add photo comparing supported and unsupported sewing -->

> **Pro tip:** Test your tape tension by pressing the center of each tape—it should deflect slightly but spring back. Too tight restricts movement; too loose causes uneven sewing.

## The Sewing Frame

A sewing frame holds tapes taut and at correct positions.

#### Frame Components

**Basic sewing frame:**
- Base board (holds the work)
- Two uprights (adjustable height)
- Crossbar (tapes attach here)
- Keys or nuts (hold tapes)
- Bar or cord (holds tape bottoms)

#### Frame Setup

1. Position tapes on crossbar at planned spacing
2. Secure top ends (keys, nuts, or clips)
3. Secure bottom ends (weighted, clamped, or tied)
4. Tapes should be vertical and taut
5. Adjust height for comfortable working

#### Without a Frame

If no frame available:
- Tape tops to wall or board edge
- Weight bottom ends
- Less ideal but workable
- Consider building or purchasing a frame

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Tapes | Linen or cotton, 1/2–3/4 inch (12–20mm) | Natural fiber preferred |
| Thread | Linen, waxed | Strong, appropriate weight |
| Signatures | Prepared, pressed | Standard |
| Needle | Straight, large eye | Must fit through holes easily |
| Sewing frame | Adjusted for your tapes | Essential for best results |

> **Budget option:** Cotton twill tape from fabric stores works well and costs a fraction of specialty bookbinding tape.

## Planning Tape Positions

Proper spacing ensures even support:

**Guidelines:**
- Tapes evenly distributed
- Distance from head/tail approximately equal
- More tapes for larger books

**Example for 9-inch (23cm) spine with 3 tapes:**
```
Head → ┌─────────────────────┐
       │ ● Kettle station 1/2 inch (12mm)
       │
       │═══ Tape 1 at 2.25 inches (57mm)
       │
       │═══ Tape 2 at 4.5 inches (114mm) - center
       │
       │═══ Tape 3 at 6.75 inches (171mm)
       │
       │ ● Kettle station 8.5 inches (216mm)
Tail → └─────────────────────┘
```

## Marking and Piercing

#### Creating the Template

1. Mark tape positions on a strip of card
2. Mark kettle stitch positions at head and tail
3. Mark entry/exit holes on either side of each tape
4. Use this template for all signatures

#### Piercing

1. Open signature to center
2. Place template at fold
3. Pierce at all marked points
4. Two holes per tape (on either side)
5. One hole each for kettle positions

**Hole spacing at tapes:** Approximately 3/8 inch (10mm) apart, tape sits between

## The Sewing Process

#### Positioning First Signature

1. Place first signature on frame base
2. Spine toward you, fold down
3. Tapes pass behind the signature
4. Position at head ready to sew

#### Sewing Signature 1

**Starting:**
1. Enter at kettle station inside (head)
2. Draw thread through, leave 3-inch (8cm) tail

**At each tape:**
3. Exit at first hole beside tape
4. Thread goes AROUND the tape (not through it)
5. Re-enter at second hole on other side of tape
6. Continue to next tape
7. Repeat around each tape
8. Exit at tail kettle station

#### Adding Signature 2

1. Position signature 2 on top of signature 1
2. Enter at tail kettle station
3. Sew through signature
4. At each tape: exit, around tape, enter
5. At head: kettle stitch
6. Tie thread to starting tail with square knot

![Step 2: Thread path showing wrap around tape](/images/diagrams/tape-sewing-path.svg)

> **Common mistake:** Sewing through the tape instead of around it. The needle and thread must pass around the outside of the tape, not pierce it.

### Continuing

For each new signature:
1. Enter at the end where you just made kettle stitch
2. Sew through signature
3. Around each tape
4. Kettle stitch at opposite end
5. Continue adding signatures

## Kettle Stitch in Tape Sewing

The kettle stitch at head and tail is the same as unsupported sewing:
1. Loop thread under the stitch connecting previous two signatures
2. Pull through, creating half-hitch
3. Snug against spine

The tapes don't change the kettle stitch - it still links signatures at the ends.

## Tension Considerations

**At tapes:**
- Pull thread snug around tape
- Tape should not pull sideways
- Consistent tension throughout

**Between tapes:**
- Inside the signature, thread is loose
- Just enough to travel without slack
- Don't pull so tight signatures bunch

**At kettle stitches:**
- Standard tension
- Links should be snug
- Creates the chain at spine ends

## Removing from Frame

When sewing is complete:

1. Tie off final kettle stitch securely
2. Cut tapes from frame, leaving 1.5–2 inch (4–5cm) extensions
3. Handle text block carefully
4. Tape extensions will attach to boards

## Post-Sewing Treatment

#### Gluing the Spine

1. Apply thin coat of PVA
2. Work around tapes
3. Don't over-apply (spine should stay flexible)
4. Tapes remain accessible

#### Knocking Down

1. Gently tap spine with hammer
2. Consolidates sewing
3. Don't crush tapes

## Board Attachment

Tapes provide strong board connection.

#### Lacing Through Boards

Traditional method:

1. Cut slots in boards for each tape
2. Slots should be tight fit
3. Thread tapes through from spine side
4. Fray tape ends
5. Paste down frayed ends
6. Cover with pastedown

**Slot cutting:**
- Two parallel cuts
- Remove strip between with chisel
- Creates channel for tape

#### Split Board Method

For very clean appearance:

1. Split board layers at edge
2. Insert tapes between layers
3. Re-adhere board layers
4. Very clean, traditional

#### Simplified Methods

**Pasted down:**
- Simply paste tape extensions to board
- Less refined but functional
- Cover with pastedown

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Tapes pulling sideways | Uneven tension | More consistent pull |
| Signatures not aligned | Poor positioning | More care placing signatures |
| Thread showing at tape | Holes too far apart | Adjust hole spacing |
| Weak joints | Tapes not well anchored | Better board attachment |
| Spine too rigid | Too much glue | Less adhesive |

> **Tool swap:** No sewing frame? Tape the ends of your tapes to a wall or clipboard and weight the bottom ends. Less ideal but workable for practice.

## Historical Context

Tape sewing evolved from sewing on cords:
- Medieval books sewn on raised cords
- Cords created bands on spine
- Tapes became popular in 18th-19th centuries
- Allowed smoother spines
- Same structural principles

## When to Use Tape Sewing

**Ideal for:**
- Library binding
- Archival binding
- Heavy books
- Books receiving heavy use
- When boards must be strongly attached

**May be unnecessary for:**
- Light journals
- Pamphlets
- Decorative exposed spine books
- Where simplicity is preferred

## Building or Buying a Frame

**DIY frame:**
- Wood base and uprights
- Threaded rod or nuts for tape attachment
- Many plans available online
- Weekend project

**Purchased frames:**
- Bookbinding suppliers
- Range from basic to professional
- Investment for serious binding

## FAQ

**How many tapes do I need?**
Two tapes for small books under 6 inches (15cm), three for medium books, four or more for large or heavy books. More tapes means more support but longer sewing time.

**Can I use ribbon instead of tape?**
Ribbon is weaker than woven tape and may not hold up to board attachment. For decorative bindings that won't see heavy use, it works; for durable books, use proper linen or cotton tape.

**Do I need a sewing frame?**
Not strictly, but it helps significantly. Without one, tape your tape ends to the wall and weight the bottoms, or have an assistant hold them taut.

**How do I know if tension is correct?**
Tapes should stay centered and not pull sideways. Signatures should compress evenly. If the spine curves or tapes shift, adjust your pull.

**What width tape should I use?**
Standard is 1/2–3/4 inch (12–20mm). Narrower tapes for small books, wider for large books. The tape width affects the slot size needed in boards.
