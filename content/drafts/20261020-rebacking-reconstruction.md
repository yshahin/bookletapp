Spine reconstruction attaches a new spine to the book while preserving as much original material and character as possible.

**TL;DR**
- New spine material should match the original in color, weight, and texture
- The original spine strip can often be laid over the new spine for authentic appearance
- Hinge flexibility is critical — the repaired book must open as well as the original

## Reconstruction Overview

The reconstruction sequence:
1. Reinforce text block spine if needed
2. Create new spine piece
3. Attach new spine to boards and text block
4. Apply original spine as decorative veneer
5. Press and finish

Each step builds on the previous, requiring patience and precision.

## Materials for Reconstruction

| Material | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| New book cloth | Spine replacement | Match original or complement |
| Binder's board | Spine stiffener (if needed) | Thin board or card |
| Mull/super | Spine reinforcement | Open weave fabric |
| Japanese tissue | Lining and repair | Various weights |
| PVA glue | Primary adhesive | Flexible when dry |
| Wheat paste | Where flexibility critical | Or paste/PVA mixture |
| Bone folder | Working material | Standard |
| Ruler and knife | Measuring and cutting | Sharp blade |

## Step 1: Reinforce the Text Block Spine

Before adding new material, ensure the spine is sound.

#### Assessing Need

**Reinforce if:**
- Spine feels weak when flexed
- Previous lining completely removed
- Sewing visible (no lining remains)
- Structural support needed

**May skip if:**
- Original super/mull remains sound
- Spine is firm and stable
- Minimal material was removed

#### Applying New Lining

1. **Cut mull** to spine width minus 5mm on each side
2. **Length** equals spine height minus 10mm (5mm short at head and tail)
3. **Apply PVA** to text block spine
4. **Position mull** centered
5. **Work out air bubbles**
6. **Mull should extend** onto boards approximately 1 inch each side

This mull connects text block to boards structurally.


## Step 2: Create the New Spine

The new spine replaces the damaged original structurally.

#### Measuring

**Width:** Spine width + board thickness (both sides) + turn-in allowance (20mm each side)
**Height:** Board height + turn-in allowance (15mm top and bottom)

#### Cutting and Preparing Cloth

1. Cut new book cloth to measurements
2. Verify grain runs head to tail
3. Mark spine edges on back of cloth
4. Mark turn-in lines

#### Spine Stiffener (Optional)

For rounded spines or added structure:

1. Cut thin card to spine width and height
2. This sits on the spine under the new cloth
3. Creates firm, defined spine
4. Not always necessary for simple repairs

## Step 3: Attach New Spine to Boards

This is the critical structural step.

#### Preparation

1. Position book open flat, spine up
2. Have adhesive and cloth ready
3. Work efficiently once adhesive applied

#### Application

1. **Apply PVA** to board surfaces where new cloth will attach (the joints and approximately 1" onto each board)
2. **Apply paste** to back of new cloth spine area
3. **Position cloth** carefully - center on spine, equal amounts on each board
4. **Press firmly** onto boards, working from spine toward fore edge
5. **Work cloth into joints** using bone folder
6. **Turn in head and tail** - cut relief at corners if needed

**Key point:** The joint area must adhere well for strong hinges.


#### Creating the Joint

The joint (or French groove) allows the cover to open properly:

1. Use bone folder to push cloth into the groove between board and spine
2. This creates the hinge line
3. Repeat on both sides
4. Define the groove clearly

## Step 4: Turn-Ins

Complete the new spine attachment.

#### Head and Tail Turn-Ins

1. Apply adhesive to turn-in area
2. Fold over and press down
3. Work corners neatly
4. Ensure clean edge at cap

#### Where New Meets Old

The new cloth overlaps onto the boards where the original cloth was lifted:

1. New cloth should sit under original board cloth (where possible)
2. Or create clean seam where they meet
3. Avoid bulk at overlap
4. The original spine piece will cover the junction

## Step 5: Reattach Original Spine

The original spine becomes a veneer over the new structure.

#### Preparation

1. Verify original spine is clean and flat
2. Ensure new spine adhesive has dried (at least 30 minutes)
3. Test fit the original piece
4. Trim if necessary to fit

#### Adhesive Choice

**Options:**
- Wheat paste: Most reversible, longest working time
- PVA: Stronger, less reversible
- Mixture: Balance of properties

For original material preservation, paste or mixture preferred.

#### Application

1. Apply adhesive to back of original spine piece (or to new spine surface)
2. Position carefully, centered on spine
3. Check alignment before pressing
4. Press firmly with hands, then bone folder
5. Work out any air bubbles toward edges

**Alignment:** The original spine should sit exactly where it originally was. Any labels, titles, or decorations should appear correctly positioned.


#### Edge Treatment

Where original spine edges meet board cloth:

**Clean edge:** Edges meet precisely, minimal visible gap
**Overlap:** Original slightly overlaps onto board cloth (can be lifted and slipped under)
**Visible seam:** Accept small gap, consistent on both sides

## Step 6: Pressing and Drying

Proper pressing ensures good adhesion and flat results.

#### Initial Press

1. Place wax paper on either side of spine
2. Position book in press or between boards
3. Apply moderate pressure
4. Don't crush any embossing on original spine
5. Leave for 30-60 minutes

#### Final Press

1. Remove wax paper
2. Check for any issues
3. Re-press if needed
4. Leave overnight

#### Joint Pressing

The joints need special attention:

1. Use knitting needles or similar in grooves
2. Hold in place with rubber bands around book
3. This keeps joints defined during drying

## Troubleshooting Reconstruction

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Joints too tight | Cloth not worked into groove | Re-dampen, work deeper |
| Joints too loose | Not enough cloth in groove | May need redo |
| Original spine bubbling | Air trapped or not enough adhesive | Lift and re-adhere |
| Misaligned spine | Positioning error | Lift while wet, reposition |
| Color mismatch | New cloth differs from boards | Choice made at planning stage |
| Hinge weak | Insufficient adhesive or mull | May need reinforcement |

## Finishing Touches

After pressing:

#### Inspecting the Repair

**Check:**
- Joints function properly (open and close smoothly)
- Original spine adhered fully
- No visible gaps or bubbles
- Spine appears centered
- Head and tail caps neat

#### Touch-Up

**Minor issues:**
- Lift and re-glue loose spots
- Adjust seam edges with microspatula
- Clean any adhesive residue

#### If Major Problems

- Assess whether to redo affected areas
- Some issues not critical to function
- Balance perfection against further intervention

## Quality Assessment

A successful reback shows:

**Structurally:**
- Strong joint function
- Solid board attachment
- Proper opening without stress
- Stable when standing on shelf

**Visually:**
- Original spine properly positioned
- Reasonable color match (or thoughtful contrast)
- Clean edges and joints
- Seamless integration of old and new

## Limitations and Honesty

Rebacking is visible repair:

**Honest approach:**
- Accept that new cloth is present
- Don't disguise repair excessively
- Preserve original spine faithfully
- Document the work

**Not forgery:**
- The original spine piece shows the book's identity
- New cloth provides function
- Combination is honest restoration
