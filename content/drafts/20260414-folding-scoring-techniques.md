Clean, precise folds along the paper grain create signatures that press flat and sew evenly.

**TL;DR**
- Always fold with the grain — cross-grain folds crack and resist lying flat
- Score heavier papers before folding to prevent cracking at the fold
- A bone folder creates crisp folds without damaging the paper surface

## Why Folding Matters

A poorly folded signature creates problems throughout the binding process:
- Uneven page edges requiring excessive trimming
- Signatures that don't nest properly
- Spine bulge from air trapped in folds
- Cracking along fold lines
- Pages that don't turn smoothly

Conversely, crisp folds:
- Create tight, compact signatures
- Allow pages to lie flat when open
- Produce clean edges
- Enable precise sewing
- Result in professional-looking books

## The Bone Folder: Your Primary Tool

The bone folder is the bookbinder's most essential hand tool. Originally made from actual bone, modern versions come in various materials.

#### Bone Folder Materials

| Material | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Genuine bone | Traditional feel, slight texture | Can stain with oils | All-around use |
| Teflon | Won't mark or burnish | Very slippery | Coated papers, photos |
| Wood (boxwood) | Warm feel, moderate firmness | Can scratch | Paper only |
| Plastic | Inexpensive, durable | Can leave marks | Learning, rough work |
| Bamboo | Sustainable, firm edge | Limited availability | General bookwork |

**Recommended:** Start with genuine bone or Teflon. Each has distinct advantages.


#### Anatomy of a Bone Folder

A quality bone folder has distinct working edges:

- **Pointed tip:** For creasing into corners and tight spaces
- **Flat edge:** For burnishing larger areas
- **Curved edge:** For smoothing rounded surfaces
- **Broad side:** For pressing and smoothing


## Scoring: Preparation for Folding

Scoring creates a compressed line in the paper that guides the fold. Proper scoring prevents cracking and ensures the fold occurs exactly where intended.

#### When to Score

**Always score:**
- Heavy papers (above 120 gsm)
- Card stock
- Cover materials
- Papers with coatings
- Cross-grain folds

**Optional scoring:**
- Light papers (below 80 gsm)
- Handmade papers with long fibers
- Papers folded with the grain

#### Scoring Methods

**Bone folder scoring:**
1. Mark your fold line lightly with pencil
2. Place a metal ruler along the line
3. Draw the bone folder point along the ruler with firm, even pressure
4. Make one confident pass (multiple passes can tear fibers)

**Empty ballpoint scoring:**
1. Use a dried-out ballpoint pen
2. Provides finer, sharper score than bone
3. Excellent for card stock
4. Risk of indentation showing through

**Scoring tool (stylus):**
1. Purpose-made tools with ball or blade tips
2. Consistent results
3. Various sizes for different weights
4. Worth investing in for frequent work

**Scoring blade:**
1. Creases without cutting
2. Used with a scoring board
3. Fast for production work
4. Requires practice to control depth


## Folding Techniques

#### The Basic Fold

For a single sheet or signature:

1. **Align edges precisely** - Corners must match exactly
2. **Hold alignment** - Use one hand to anchor the positioned paper
3. **Begin fold at center** - Press down in the middle of the fold line
4. **Work outward** - Use bone folder from center toward each edge
5. **Final burnish** - One smooth pass along the entire fold

**Critical:** Never fold toward yourself. Always fold away, so you can see the alignment.

#### Folding Multiple Sheets (Signatures)

When folding multiple sheets nested together:

1. **Fold each sheet individually first** (optional but recommended for precision)
2. **Nest sheets together** - Align all folds
3. **Apply pressure evenly** - Use pressing boards and weights
4. **Final bone folder pass** - Burnish the nested fold as one unit

**Alternative method for production:**
1. Stack all sheets aligned
2. Fold as a unit
3. Bone folder vigorously
4. Faster but slightly less precise

#### Folding a Folio (Single Sheet, Two Leaves)

1. Orient paper with grain parallel to intended spine
2. Bring bottom edge up to meet top edge precisely
3. Adjust until corners align perfectly
4. Hold in place with one hand
5. Press center with bone folder to anchor
6. Sweep folder toward one edge
7. Return to center, sweep to other edge
8. Final pass across entire fold


#### Folding a Quarto (Single Sheet, Four Leaves)

A quarto fold creates 8 pages from one sheet:

1. First fold: Fold in half, grain parallel to fold
2. Bone folder thoroughly
3. Second fold: Fold in half again, perpendicular to first fold
4. This second fold is cross-grain (score first if paper is heavy)
5. Bone folder the second fold

**Note:** The second fold fights the grain. Extra care needed.

#### Folding an Octavo (Single Sheet, Eight Leaves)

1. Complete quarto fold first
2. Third fold: Fold in half again
3. Creates 16 pages from one sheet
4. Multiple cross-grain folds require scoring and careful pressure

## Common Folding Problems

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cracking at fold | Cross-grain without scoring | Always score cross-grain folds |
| Uneven edges | Misalignment before folding | Take time to align precisely |
| Fold not sharp | Insufficient bone folder pressure | More passes, more pressure |
| Paper curling | Static or humidity | Condition paper first |
| Offset fold | Paper slipped during folding | Anchor center first |
| White line at fold | Coating cracking | Score before folding, consider different paper |

## Advanced: Folding Cover Materials

Cover materials require special attention due to their weight and composition.

#### Book Cloth

Book cloth has paper backing that can crack:

1. Always score before folding
2. Score on the paper backing side
3. Use moderate pressure
4. Fold slowly and carefully
5. Avoid over-burnishing (flattens texture)

#### Heavy Paper and Card Stock

1. Score deeply but don't cut through
2. Fold toward the scored line (the V opens, not closes)
3. Work in short sections
4. May need to break the fibers gradually

#### Leather

Leather folds differently than paper:

1. Pare (thin) the fold area first
2. Dampen slightly if needed
3. Fold over a straight edge
4. Hold in position until set
5. Do not use bone folder on grain side (burnishes the surface)


## Grain Direction and Folding

Grain direction profoundly affects folding. Paper folds most easily parallel to its grain.

**Identifying grain:**
1. Bend test: Paper bends more easily parallel to grain
2. Tear test: Tears straighter with the grain
3. Wet test: Paper curls with grain parallel to curl axis

**Fold direction principles:**
- With grain: Clean fold, no scoring needed for light papers
- Against grain: Requires scoring, prone to cracking

**For signatures:**
- Grain should run parallel to the spine
- This means your fold is WITH the grain
- Ensures pages turn easily and lie flat

## Creating a Folding Template

For consistent signature sizes, create a folding jig:

**Materials:**
- Rigid board (mat board or plywood)
- Two L-shaped guides
- Measurements marked clearly

**Using the jig:**
1. Place sheet against guides
2. Fold meets predetermined mark
3. Produces identical signatures every time


## Pressing After Folding

Folded signatures need pressing to:
- Set the folds permanently
- Remove trapped air
- Compact the signatures
- Flatten any warping

**Pressing method:**
1. Stack folded signatures between pressing boards
2. Add weight (bricks, heavy books, pressing iron)
3. Leave overnight minimum
4. Check and re-press if needed

**Nipping press alternative:**
- Quick, high-pressure option
- 30-second press achieves similar results
- Requires equipment investment

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Perfect folio**
1. Cut 10 sheets of copy paper to A4
2. Fold each into a folio
3. Stack and compare edges
4. Goal: All edges align within 1mm

**Exercise 2: Quarto comparison**
1. Fold one sheet without scoring
2. Fold one sheet with scoring
3. Compare crispness and cracking
4. Try both with and against grain

**Exercise 3: Signature batch**
1. Create 5 identical 4-sheet signatures
2. Press overnight
3. Measure spine thickness consistency
4. Goal: Less than 0.5mm variation

## Tools for Folding

**Essential:**
- Bone folder

## Maintaining Your Bone Folder

A well-maintained bone folder performs better:

**Cleaning:**
- Wipe with slightly damp cloth
- Remove adhesive residue promptly
- Keep free of paper dust

**Conditioning (genuine bone):**
- Occasional light waxing with beeswax
- Maintains smooth surface
- Prevents drying and cracking

**Storage:**
- Wrap in soft cloth
- Store flat
- Keep away from extreme temperatures
