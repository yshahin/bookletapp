Choosing the right thread for your binding project determines both the strength and visual character of the finished book.

**TL;DR**
- Linen is the traditional workhorse — strong, archival, and holds knots well
- Silk offers the best strength-to-weight ratio and beautiful appearance for fine binding
- Match thread weight to paper weight so sewing doesn't overwhelm delicate signatures

## Thread Properties That Matter

When selecting thread, consider:

**Strength:** Must withstand sewing tension and long-term stress
**Smoothness:** Affects how easily it passes through holes
**Elasticity:** Some give helps absorb stress; too much causes loosening
**Appearance:** Visible in exposed spine bindings
**Longevity:** Must outlast the book it binds

**Ideal for:**
- Practice and learning
- Journals and sketchbooks
- Lighter-weight books
- Budget projects
- When availability matters

**Advantages:**
- Easy to find
- Affordable
- Comfortable to work with
- Good color selection

**Disadvantages:**
- Weaker than linen
- May stretch over time
- Less archival than linen
- Can deteriorate faster

## Polyester Thread

The modern synthetic option.

#### Characteristics

- Synthetic fiber
- Very strong
- No stretch
- Smooth surface
- Does not rot or degrade from moisture
- Consistent manufacturing

#### Available Forms

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Binder's polyester | Specifically for bookbinding | All binding |
-- Upholstery polyester | Very strong, thicker | Heavy books |
| General sewing | Thin, less suitable | Not recommended |

#### When to Use Polyester

**Ideal for:**
- Books exposed to humidity/moisture
- Outdoor journals
- Modern aesthetic
- When maximum strength needed
- Conservation binding (non-reactive)

**Advantages:**
- Exceptional strength
- Moisture resistant

- Archival (won't rot)

**Disadvantages:**
- Non-traditional feel
- Very smooth (can be harder to tension)
- Synthetic appearance
- Some prefer natural materials

> **Common mistake:** Using thread that's too thick for your paper. Heavy thread on lightweight paper tears through the fold. The thread should nestle into the fold without bulging.

## Comparative Table

| Property | Linen | Silk | Cotton | Polyester |
|----------|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| Strength | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Stretch | Minimal | Minimal | Some | None |
| Appearance | Matte | Lustrous | Matte | Smooth |
| Cost | High | Highest | Low | Moderate |
| Availability | Specialty | Specialty | Wide | Wide |
| Archival | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Feel | Wiry | Smooth | Soft | Smooth |

## Thread Weight and Sizing

Thread thickness must match paper and project:

#### Measuring Thread

**Cord count:** Number of plies twisted together (3-cord, 6-cord, etc.)
**Pound rating:** Traditional system (higher = thinner)
**Metric:** Tex or denier measurements

#### Matching Thread to Project

| Project Type | Paper Weight | Recommended Thread |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pamphlets | Light | Fine/thin thread |
| Journals | Medium | Medium weight |
| Heavy books | Heavy | Thick/strong thread |
| Coptic | Visible | Medium, appearance matters |
| Stab binding | Decorative | Heavier, visible |

**General rule:** Thread should not be thicker than the paper can comfortably accommodate without tearing.

## Waxing Thread

Wax treatment improves thread performance.

#### Why Wax Thread

- Reduces tangling
- Strengthens the thread
- Eases passage through holes
- Adds slight stiffness for control
- Helps thread grip in knots

#### How to Wax

1. Obtain beeswax block
2. Hold thread taut
3. Draw thread across wax
4. Repeat 2-3 times
5. Pull through fingers to distribute and remove excess

#### Wax Options

**Beeswax:** Traditional, slightly sticky
**Microcrystalline wax:** More refined, less sticky
**Pre-waxed thread:** Convenient, consistent


> **Budget option:** Waxed linen from leather craft suppliers is often the same quality as bookbinding-specific thread at a lower price. Check the weight and buy a sample first.

## Thread for Specific Bindings

#### Coptic Binding

**Priority:** Appearance (thread visible)
**Recommendation:** Linen or silk
**Weight:** Medium
**Notes:** Color choice important

#### Japanese Stab Binding

**Priority:** Decorative, strong
**Recommendation:** Silk or linen
**Weight:** Heavier, creates pattern
**Notes:** Often contrasting colors

#### Case Binding

**Priority:** Strength, hidden
**Recommendation:** Linen or polyester
**Weight:** Medium to heavy
**Notes:** Appearance less critical

#### Long Stitch

**Priority:** Visible, decorative
**Recommendation:** Linen or silk
**Weight:** Medium to heavy
**Notes:** Consider color carefully

#### Pamphlet Stitch

**Priority:** Proportional to size
**Recommendation:** Any suitable
**Weight:** Light to medium
**Notes:** Don't overpower delicate signatures

## Sourcing Quality Thread

#### Specialty Suppliers

- Bookbinding supply houses
- Conservation suppliers
- Weaving and fiber arts suppliers
- Some sewing notions suppliers

#### Evaluating Quality

**Good thread:**
- Consistent diameter throughout
- No weak spots
- Even twist
- No pills or lumps

**Avoid:**
- Fuzzy, uneven thread
- Very cheap alternatives
- Thread with knots or joins
- Old, degraded stock

## Storage and Care

**Store thread:**
- Away from direct light
- In stable humidity
- Protected from dust
- Wound neatly (not tangled)

**Thread longevity:**
- Quality thread lasts decades properly stored
- Heat and humidity accelerate degradation
- Rotate stock if you have a lot

> **Tool swap:** No beeswax block? A plain white candle (unscented) works for waxing thread in a pinch. Microcrystalline wax is the professional alternative.

## Glossary

- **Cord count:** Number of plies twisted together in a thread (e.g., 3-cord, 6-cord)
- **Waxing:** Drawing thread across beeswax to reduce tangling, add stiffness, and ease passage through holes
- **Swell:** Increased spine thickness from thread buildup — affected by thread weight and sewing stations
- **Polished linen:** Linen thread with a smooth finish and slight sheen, preferred for fine binding
- **Tex:** Metric measurement of thread weight — weight in grams of 1,000 meters of thread

## FAQ

**What's the best all-around thread for beginners?**
Waxed linen in medium weight. It's forgiving, holds knots well, and works for most binding styles. Buy a spool and you'll use it for dozens of projects.

**Do I have to wax my thread?**
Not if you buy pre-waxed thread. If using unwaxed thread, waxing is strongly recommended — it prevents tangling and helps thread grip in stitches.

**Can I use regular sewing thread?**
Standard sewing thread (polyester or cotton) is too thin and slippery for most bookbinding. It works only for very light pamphlet stitching.

**How much thread do I need per project?**
Roughly 2.5 times the spine height per signature, plus extra for starting and finishing. Better to have too much than to run out mid-sewing.

**Does thread color matter?**
For hidden sewing (case binding), no. For exposed-spine bindings (Coptic, long stitch, stab), thread color is a design choice that significantly affects appearance.
