Spattering creates a distinctive speckled pattern on book edges using nothing more than a stiff brush, paint, and a screen.

**TL;DR**
- Dip a stiff brush in diluted acrylic and draw across a screen to spatter
- Multiple light passes create better results than one heavy application
- Mask the spine and covers carefully before spattering to protect them

## History of Edge Decoration

Edge decoration serves both practical and aesthetic purposes:

**Practical benefits:**
- Hides dust and handling marks
- Distinguishes books in a collection
- Makes fore edge easier to grip
- Can indicate categories (library systems)

**Historical use:**
- Common from 16th century onward
- Applied before binding completion
- Various colors indicated different purposes
- Red edges common for religious texts

## Understanding Spattered Edges

Spattering creates random dots by flicking pigmented liquid onto the edge:

```
Before:          After:
┌────────┐      ┌────────┐
│        │      │ .  . . │
│        │      │. . .  .│
│  Edge  │  →   │ .. . . │
│        │      │. .  . .│
│        │      │ . .. . │
└────────┘      └────────┘
```

The randomness is the charm - each application is unique.


## Materials Needed

| Material | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Acrylic ink or watercolor | Pigment | Concentrated color preferred |
| Small brush or toothbrush | Spattering tool | Stiff bristles work best |
| Knife or stick | For flicking | To draw across bristles |
| Press or clamps | Hold text block | Essential for clean edges |
| Waste paper/plastic | Surface protection | Spatter goes everywhere |
| Scrap paper | Test strips | Dial in consistency |

## Preparing the Text Block

The text block must be properly prepared:

#### Pressing

1. Clamp text block firmly in press
2. Expose only the edge being spattered
3. Edge should be perfectly aligned
4. No pages can shift during process

**Without a press:**
- Sandwich between boards
- Clamp with large clips
- Weight heavily
- Verify edge alignment

#### Choosing Which Edge

**Fore edge:** Most visible, traditional choice
**Head edge:** Often decorated in fine binding
**Tail edge:** Less common, sometimes matching head
**All three:** Most complete decoration


## Preparing the Spatter Medium

The consistency of your pigment determines the result.

#### Mixing

1. Start with concentrated pigment (ink or watercolor)
2. Add water gradually
3. Test on scrap paper
4. Adjust to desired effect

**Consistency guide:**
- Too thick: Large blobs, uneven coverage
- Too thin: Runs and bleeds
- Just right: Distinct dots, varied sizes

#### Color Choices

**Traditional colors:**
- Red: Religious texts, special editions
- Brown/sepia: Antiquarian appearance
- Blue: General use, popular historically
- Green: Less common, distinctive

**Modern options:**
- Multiple colors (applied in layers)
- Metallic inks
- Custom mixed colors

## Spattering Techniques

Several methods achieve the spattered effect:

#### Method 1: Toothbrush and Knife

Classic technique:

1. Dip toothbrush in prepared ink
2. Hold over edge, bristles pointing down
3. Draw knife or stick across bristles toward yourself
4. Bristles snap back, flicking ink toward edge
5. Repeat for coverage

**Tips:**
- Distance affects dot size (closer = larger)
- Bristle load affects density
- Multiple light passes better than one heavy
- Rotate brush position for randomness

#### Method 2: Flicking Brush

Alternative approach:

1. Dip small brush in ink
2. Hold over edge
3. Tap brush handle sharply with finger
4. Ink flies off in drops
5. Repeat for coverage

**Results:** Larger, more irregular droplets

#### Method 3: Spray Bottle

Modern variation:

1. Fill spray bottle with diluted ink
2. Adjust nozzle for fine mist
3. Spray from distance
4. Build up gradually

**Results:** Very fine, even spatter

## Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Prepare Workspace

1. Cover all surfaces with plastic or newspaper
2. Spatter travels - protect more than you think
3. Work in area without wind or air circulation
4. Have test strips ready

#### Step 2: Secure Text Block

1. Clamp in press, edge up
2. Verify perfect alignment
3. Mask any areas not to be spattered
4. Mask spine if binding already attached

#### Step 3: Test Your Mixture

1. Hold brush over test strip
2. Spatter using your chosen method
3. Evaluate:
   - Dot size
   - Coverage density
   - Consistency
4. Adjust mixture or technique as needed

#### Step 4: Apply to Edge

1. Position yourself comfortably
2. Begin spattering from one end
3. Work systematically across edge
4. Multiple light passes
5. Check coverage, add more if needed
6. Allow slight overlap for even coverage

#### Step 5: Dry

1. Leave in press while drying
2. Don't touch or test - fingerprints show
3. Allow minimum 30 minutes
4. Longer for heavy applications

#### Step 6: Additional Edges (Optional)

1. When first edge is dry, rotate
2. Repeat process for next edge
3. Protect dried edges with paper


## Creating Different Effects

#### Dense Coverage

- Multiple passes
- Higher pigment concentration
- Brush held closer

#### Light Speckling

- Single pass
- More diluted ink
- Brush held further away

#### Two-Color Spatter

1. Apply first color, let dry completely
2. Apply second color over first
3. Colors intermingle visually
4. Creates depth and interest

#### Gradient Effect

1. Start with concentrated spatter at one end
2. Gradually reduce concentration
3. Or increase distance as you work
4. Creates fade effect

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Blobs instead of dots | Ink too thick or brush overloaded | Dilute ink, shake off excess |
| Dots bleeding/fuzzy | Ink too thin | Thicken mixture |
| Uneven coverage | Inconsistent technique | More systematic passes |
| Spatter on covers | Inadequate masking | Better protection next time |
| Ink running between pages | Pages not tight enough | Press harder |
| Dots too uniform | Mechanical technique | Vary distance and brush load |

## Protecting Your Work

After spattering, consider sealing:

**For durability:**
- Light coat of matte fixative spray
- Adds slight protection from handling
- Don't oversaturate (affects texture)

**Historical approach:**
- Traditional spattered edges were left uncoated
- Book handling patterns developed over time
- Part of the book's character

## Alternatives to Traditional Spattering

#### Sponge Application

- Dab with loaded natural sponge
- Creates mottled rather than dotted effect
- Different texture

#### Stenciling

- Cut stencil for pattern
- Spatter through stencil
- Creates intentional shapes within spatter

#### Marbled Edges

- More complex technique
- Book edge dragged across marbling bath
- Unique, unrepeatable patterns

## Historical Examples

Museums and rare book collections show centuries of spattered edges:

**16th-17th century:**
- Simple single-color spattering
- Often red or brown
- Applied to most bound books

**18th century:**
- More elaborate patterns
- Sometimes combined with gilt
- Color coordination with covers

**19th century:**
- Industrial application became common
- More uniform results
- Still found on library bindings

## Practice Projects

**Project 1: Test blocks**
- Create several dummy text blocks
- Practice different techniques
- Compare results
- No pressure - purely experimental

**Project 2: Simple journal**
- Bind a simple pamphlet or notebook
- Spatter fore edge before binding
- See how decoration integrates with finished book

**Project 3: Three-edge coordination**
- Plan colors for all three edges
- Execute with consistent technique
- Create unified decorative scheme
