This project guides you through creating a round-backed case binding with hollow back construction.

**TL;DR**
- Sew an 8-signature text block, then round and back the spine
- Construct a hollow back for flexible spine movement
- Build a case that accommodates the shaped spine with proper shoulder fit

## Project Overview

**Structure:** Rounded and backed case binding with hollow back
**Finished size:** 6 × 9 inches (15 × 23cm)
**Signatures:** 8 signatures, 4 sheets each
**Spine style:** English round with defined shoulders
**Time required:** 6–8 hours over multiple sessions
**Skill level:** Intermediate to Advanced

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Text paper | 80 GSM, grain long | 32 sheets 6 × 18 inches (15 × 46cm) |
| Endpaper stock | 100 GSM, grain long | 4 sheets |
| Binder's board | 2.5mm (3/32 inch) | 2 pieces 6.25 × 9.25 inches (16 × 24cm) |
| Spine board | 1.5mm (1/16 inch) | 1 piece (calculated width × 9 inches / 23cm) |
| Book cloth | Enough to cover case | Approximately 10 × 14 inches (25 × 36cm) |
| Thread | Linen, medium weight | 60 inches (150cm) |
| Spine lining (mull) | Open weave fabric | Strip 2 inches (5cm) wide × spine length |
| Kraft paper | For hollow back | Strip |
| PVA glue | Flexible | As needed |
| Headband material | Or pre-made headbands | 2 pieces |

> **Budget option:** Use pre-made headbands instead of hand-sewn for your first project. They work well and let you focus on the core rounding and backing techniques.

## Phase 1: Preparing the Text Block

#### Folding Signatures

1. Cut text paper to 6 × 18 inches (15 × 46cm)
2. Fold each sheet in half (grain parallel to fold)
3. Nest 4 sheets per signature = 8 signatures total
4. Press overnight between boards with weight

#### Making Endpapers

1. Cut endpaper stock to 6 × 18 inches (15 × 46cm)
2. Fold in half
3. Create 4 folded endpapers
4. Two will wrap first signature, two will wrap last

**Attachment:**
- Tip one endpaper to outside of first signature (thin line of paste at fold)
- Tip one endpaper to outside of last signature
- Two spare endpapers for later attachment

#### Marking and Punching Stations

For this project, use 5 sewing stations:

**Measurements from head:**
- Station 1: 1/2 inch (12mm)
- Station 2: 2 inches (50mm)
- Station 3: 4.5 inches (115mm) — center
- Station 4: 7 inches (180mm)
- Station 5: 8.5 inches (215mm)

Create template and pierce all signatures identically.

## Phase 2: Sewing the Text Block

Use kettle stitch sewing with 5 stations:

1. Thread needle with 60 inches (150cm) waxed linen
2. Begin at Station 1 of Signature 1, leave 4-inch (10cm) tail
3. Sew through all stations
4. Add Signature 2, kettle stitch at exit
5. Continue through all 8 signatures
6. Finish with double kettle stitch, tie off

**Sewing tension:** Moderate — tight enough to hold but not so tight that signatures bunch. A properly sewn text block for rounding needs some swell.

> **Pro tip:** For round-back books, err on the side of slightly more swell. The rounding process compresses the spine somewhat, so extra swell helps maintain the curve.

## Phase 3: Preparing for Rounding

#### Gluing the Spine

1. Fan text block slightly
2. Apply thin coat of PVA to spine
3. Work into gaps between signatures
4. Let dry 30 minutes
5. Apply second thin coat
6. Let dry completely (1–2 hours)

**Important:** Spine glue should be flexible when dry, not brittle.

#### Trimming (Optional)

If edges are uneven, trim now:
1. Use a plough or sharp blade with straight edge
2. Trim fore edge first
3. Then head, then tail
4. Remove minimum necessary

Many binders leave untrimmed for handmade aesthetic.

## Phase 4: Rounding the Spine

#### Setup

1. Place text block on clean, flat surface
2. Have backing hammer ready
3. Work in area where you can apply force

#### Rounding Process

1. Hold text block with fore edge toward you
2. Using hammer or hands, push center of spine away from you
3. Simultaneously pull fore edge toward you
4. Text block begins to curve
5. Flip over and repeat from other side
6. Work gradually — multiple light efforts better than forcing

**Hand rounding technique:**
- Grip text block firmly
- Thumbs on spine, fingers on fore edge
- Roll spine forward while curving fore edge back
- Work from center outward

**Checking your work:**
- View from head or tail
- Spine should show even curve
- Fore edge should mirror with concave curve
- Arc should be approximately 1/3 of spine width

## Phase 5: Backing the Spine

#### Setting Up in Backing Press

1. Place backing boards against text block
2. Boards should be exactly at shoulder line (where cover boards will sit)
3. Leave spine exposed
4. Clamp firmly in press or between boards in vise

**Alignment critical:** Boards must be parallel and at equal height on both sides.

#### Backing Process

1. Begin at center of spine
2. Angle backing hammer to push signatures outward
3. Work from center toward one edge
4. Light, overlapping blows
5. Repeat from center toward other edge
6. Alternate sides to maintain symmetry
7. Continue until shoulders form

**Shoulder formation:**
- Outer signatures fold over backing boards
- Creates ridge approximately equal to board thickness
- Shoulder should be consistent along full spine length

> **Common mistake:** Backing only the center of the spine. Work the entire length systematically from center outward, alternating sides to keep shoulders even.

#### Checking Backing

- Shoulder height even along spine
- Both shoulders same height
- Spine curve maintained
- No signatures crushed or damaged

## Phase 6: Spine Linings

#### First Lining (Mull)

1. Cut mull to spine width × text block height
2. Apply PVA to spine
3. Press mull into wet glue
4. Smooth from center outward
5. Let dry

**Mull overhang:** Should extend 1 inch (25mm) beyond spine onto front and back — this anchors text block to case.

#### Second Lining (Paper)

1. Cut kraft paper to spine width (within shoulders)
2. Glue and apply over mull
3. This strengthens and smooths the spine

![Step 3: Spine with mull and paper linings applied](/images/diagrams/spine-linings-applied.jpg)

## Phase 7: Creating the Hollow Back

A hollow back allows the spine covering to flex independently of the text block spine.

#### Making the Hollow

1. Cut kraft paper: Width = spine width × 3, Height = spine height minus 1/4 inch (6mm)
2. Fold in thirds lengthwise
3. Glue one-third to itself (creating a tube)
4. Glue outside of tube to text block spine
5. Loose outer layer will attach to case spine

```
Cross-section of hollow:

     ┌─────────────────┐
     │    Loose outer  │
     │  ┌───────────┐  │
     │  │  Glued to │  │
     │  │  spine    │  │
     └──┴───────────┴──┘
```

## Phase 8: Attaching Headbands

Headbands protect spine ends and add decoration.

1. Cut headbands to spine width
2. Position at head with colored edge facing out
3. Glue in place
4. Repeat at tail

**Option:** Make your own sewn headbands (advanced technique).

## Phase 9: Making the Case

#### Measuring for Rounded Spine

The case must accommodate the round:

**Board height:** Text block height + 6mm (1/4 inch) — 3mm squares
**Board width:** Text block width + 3mm (1/8 inch) — fore edge square
**Spine piece width:** Measure around the curve, not flat across

**Measuring spine width:**
- Wrap strip of paper around spine from shoulder to shoulder
- Mark and measure — this is your spine width

#### Cutting and Assembling

1. Cut two boards to calculated size
2. Cut spine piece (use thinner board, 1.5mm)
3. Cut book cloth 1 inch (25mm) larger than assembled case

**Assembly:**
1. Position boards on book cloth with spine piece between
2. Gap between boards and spine: Slightly larger than for flat spine
3. Glue and wrap book cloth
4. Turn in edges

## Phase 10: Casing In

Attaching the rounded text block to the case requires care.

#### Positioning

1. Apply paste to mull overhangs and first endpaper (waste sheet)
2. Position text block in case, spine in spine hollow
3. Press firmly, especially at shoulders
4. Close front cover, position for even squares
5. Press for initial adhesion

> **Tool swap:** No finishing press? Place waxed paper at the joints, close the book, and weight heavily. Check after 30 minutes to ensure proper joint formation.

#### Completing the Case-In

1. Turn book over
2. Apply paste to other mull overhang and endpaper
3. Close back cover
4. Check alignment
5. Place in press or under weights overnight

## Quality Checkpoints

After completion, evaluate:

**Structure:**

- [ ] Shoulders accommodate boards
- [ ] Book opens without strain
- [ ] Closes flat without gapping

**Appearance:**
- [ ] Squares even on all sides
- [ ] Spine covering smooth
- [ ] Corners sharp and neat
- [ ] No adhesive showing

**Function:**
- [ ] Opens to comfortable angle
- [ ] Pages turn easily
- [ ] Spine flexes naturally
- [ ] Returns to shape when closed

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix/Prevention |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Lost the round | Pressed flat before case | Work quickly at casing-in |
| Uneven shoulders | Backing inconsistent | Practice backing technique |
| Boards don't fit shoulders | Measured incorrectly | Re-measure around curve |
| Spine hollow collapsed | Hollow construction error | Ensure tube properly formed |
| Book won't close | Shoulders too pronounced | More conservative backing |

## Variations

**Quarter leather:**
Add leather to spine and corners for durability and elegance.

**Tight back instead of hollow:**
Glue covering directly to spine — simpler but less flex.

**Flat back with false round:**
Create appearance of round on case only — faster but less functional.

## Glossary

- **Hollow back:** A tube construction allowing the spine covering to flex independently of the text block spine
- **Mull:** Open-weave fabric used to reinforce the spine and attach text block to covers
- **Shoulder:** The ridge formed during backing where cover boards nestle into the spine edge
- **Knocking down:** Gently tapping the spine to consolidate sewing before rounding
- **Squares:** The portion of cover boards that extends beyond the text block edges

## FAQ

**How do I know when I've rounded enough?**
View the spine from head or tail. The curve should be gentle and even, with the fore edge showing a corresponding concave curve. The arc should project about 1/3 of the spine thickness.

**Why did my round flatten during casing-in?**
You may have pressed too hard on the spine during casing-in, or the book sat too long before being pressed. Work quickly and press at the joints, not the spine center.

**Can I skip the hollow back?**
Yes, for a tight back binding. However, hollow backs allow the spine to flex more naturally when opening, so they're preferred for frequently used books.

**How long should I wait between phases?**
Allow spine glue to dry 1–2 hours before rounding. After backing, let the structure set before adding linings. Overnight drying between major phases is ideal.

**What if my shoulders are uneven?**
Minor unevenness can be accommodated during casing-in by positioning boards carefully. Significant unevenness requires practicing backing technique on future projects.
