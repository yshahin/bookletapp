A slipcase protects a book while displaying its spine, and building one introduces fundamental box-making skills.

**TL;DR**
- A slipcase is a five-sided box with the spine side open for display
- Precise measurement with ease allowances ensures proper fit
- Skills learned transfer directly to clamshell boxes and portfolios

## Understanding Slipcase Construction

A slipcase is essentially a five-sided box:
- Two sides (parallel to book covers)
- A back (opposite the open end)
- A head piece
- A tail piece
- Open front (spine displays through)

The book's spine faces outward through the open side.

### Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Binder's board | 2mm thickness | Enough for 5 pieces |
| Covering material | Book cloth or decorative paper | Sufficient to wrap exterior |
| Lining paper | Decorative or plain | For interior |
| PVA glue | Bookbinding quality | As needed |
| Waste paper | For gluing | Several sheets |
| Weights | For pressing | Heavy books or bricks |

### Measuring for the Slipcase

Precision is critical. Measure your book carefully.

#### Taking Measurements

**Book dimensions needed:**
- Height (head to tail)
- Width (spine to fore edge)
- Thickness (front board to back board)

**Measurement tips:**
- Measure at multiple points (books aren't always square)
- Use the largest dimension if there's variation
- Measure with book closed, pressed gently

#### Calculating Board Sizes

**Adding ease:**
The slipcase must be slightly larger than the book for easy insertion/removal.

**Standard ease allowances:**
- Height: Book height + 3mm (total)
- Width: Book width + 2mm (total)
- Thickness: Book thickness + 2mm (total)

**Example calculation:**
Book dimensions: 150mm H x 100mm W x 25mm thick

Slipcase interior:
- Height: 153mm
- Width: 102mm
- Depth: 27mm

#### Board Cutting List

For standard construction (board thickness = T):

| Piece | Dimensions |
|-------|------------|
| 2 Side boards | Interior width x Interior depth |
| 1 Back board | Interior height x (Interior depth + T) |
| 1 Head board | Interior height x (Interior width + 2T) |
| 1 Tail board | Interior height x (Interior width + 2T) |

**Note:** These dimensions create a wrapped construction where head/tail boards overlap the edges.

### Construction Methods

Two main approaches exist:

#### Method 1: Wrapped Construction (Recommended for beginners)

1. Cover boards individually
2. Assemble covered boards with glue
3. Touch up corners and joints

#### Method 2: Case Construction

1. Assemble boards first
2. Cover the assembled box as a unit
3. More efficient but requires more skill

This tutorial uses Method 1.

### Step-by-Step Assembly

#### Step 1: Cut All Boards

1. Mark boards precisely
2. Cut with board shears or knife/ruler
3. Verify all dimensions before proceeding
4. Label pieces (S1, S2, Back, Head, Tail)

**Square check:** Stack like pieces - they should be identical

#### Step 2: Plan the Covering

The covering wraps exterior surfaces:

**For wrapped construction:**
- Each piece gets its own covering section
- Allow 20mm turn-in on all wrapped edges
- Plan which edges wrap and which butt against other pieces

#### Step 3: Cover the Back Board

1. Cut covering material: board size + 40mm (20mm turn-in each side)
2. Apply PVA to board
3. Position on covering material
4. Turn in all four edges
5. Miter corners for neat finish

#### Step 4: Cover the Side Boards

Each side board needs covering on one face:

1. Cut covering: board size + turn-in on three edges
2. The fourth edge (at the open front) butts to other pieces
3. Cover and turn in
4. Press flat

#### Step 5: Cover Head and Tail Boards

Similar to sides:
1. Covering on one face
2. Turn-in on three edges
3. One edge will butt to adjacent pieces

<!-- TODO: Add photos showing covering process -->

### Assembly

With pieces covered, assemble the box.

#### Assembly Order

1. Attach sides to back
2. Add head piece
3. Add tail piece
4. Touch up joints

#### Step 6: Attach Sides to Back

1. Apply PVA to edge of back board where side will attach
2. Position side board, interior surface facing in
3. Hold or clamp in place
4. Repeat with second side
5. Check for square (corners should be 90 degrees)

#### Step 7: Attach Head and Tail

1. Apply PVA to edges where head/tail will attach
2. Position carefully - these overlap the side edges
3. Check for square
4. Clamp or tape to hold while drying

#### Step 8: Reinforce Joints (Optional)

For strength:
1. Apply thin strip of covering over exterior joints
2. Use matching or decorative paper
3. Creates visual feature while strengthening

### Lining the Interior

The interior should be lined for finished appearance.

#### Measuring Lining Pieces

Each interior surface needs its own lining:
- Measure actual interior dimensions
- Cut lining paper 2mm smaller than each surface
- This creates a small margin and prevents lining from buckling

#### Applying Lining

1. Start with the back interior
2. Apply paste to lining paper
3. Position carefully, centered
4. Smooth from center outward
5. Continue with sides, then head/tail

### Testing the Fit

Before declaring success:

1. Insert the book
2. Should slide in smoothly but not loosely
3. Should slide out without excessive force
4. Spine should be visible and centered

**If too tight:** Sand interior surfaces lightly
**If too loose:** Add thin lining material or rebuild

### Finishing Options

#### Thumb Notch

A curved cutout at the open edge makes book removal easier:

1. Mark semicircle at center of open edge
2. Cut with curved blade or files
3. Cover cut edge with thin strip
4. Optional but practical

#### Label Panel

Add a panel for title:
1. Cut window in covering before assembly
2. Or add raised panel after construction
3. Label can be printed or hand-lettered

#### Edge Treatment

For exposed board edges at opening:
- Paint with acrylic to match covering
- Cover with thin strip of material
- Leave natural for industrial aesthetic

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Slipcase not square | Careless assembly | Check square during gluing, rebuild if necessary |
| Book too tight | Insufficient ease | Sand interior or rebuild |
| Book too loose | Too much ease | Line interior with paper |
| Corners not neat | Poor mitering | Practice mitering technique |
| Covering bubbles | Air trapped or too much glue | Work from center outward |
| Joints weak | Insufficient glue or poor contact | Reinforce with strip |

### Design Variations

#### Open Back

Spine and back both visible:
- Omit back board
- Book displays more openly
- Less protection

#### Double Slipcase

For multi-volume sets:
- Divider in center
- Two books, one case
- Elegant presentation

#### Drop-Spine Slipcase

Hybrid with clamshell elements:
- Opening at spine edge
- More protective
- Advanced construction

### Skills Developed

Box making for slipcases teaches:
- Precise measurement
- Board cutting and squaring
- Covering techniques
- Assembly and clamping
- Interior lining

These skills apply directly to:
- Clamshell boxes
- Portfolios
- Presentation boxes
- Other enclosures

### Practice Tips

**First slipcase:**
- Use an expendable book for fitting
- Basic materials (chipboard, kraft paper covering)
- Focus on achieving square construction

**Second slipcase:**
- Better materials
- Add thumb notch
- Interior lining

**Third slipcase:**
- Quality materials
- All finishing details
- For a book you want to protect

### Conclusion

A well-made slipcase protects while displaying. The construction process seems complex but reduces to careful measurement, precise cutting, and systematic assembly.

Start with simple materials to learn the process, then apply those skills to create slipcases for books you value. The same principles will serve you for all future box-making projects.
