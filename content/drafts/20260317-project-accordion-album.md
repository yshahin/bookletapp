The accordion book (also called concertina, leporello, or orihon) is one of the oldest and most versatile book structures.

**TL;DR**
- One continuous paper strip folds into 12 panels, attached to hard covers at each end
- Grain must run perpendicular to the strip length (parallel to folds)
- Display options include standing zigzag, panorama, or traditional page-turning

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Heavy paper | 100–140 lb (270–380 GSM), grain short | Strip 6 × 72 inches (15 × 183cm) or joined pieces |
| Binder's board | 1/16 inch (2mm) | 2 pieces, 6.25 × 6.25 inches (16 × 16cm) |
| Book cloth | Enough to cover | Approximately 8 × 16 inches (20 × 41cm) |
| Decorative paper | For endpapers | 2 pieces, 6 × 6 inches (15 × 15cm) |
| PVA glue | As needed | — |
| Bone folder | — | For crisp folds |
| Ruler and pencil | — | For measuring |

> **Budget option:** Use heavyweight scrapbook paper instead of binder's board for a softer cover. Works well for practice projects.

## Understanding Paper Requirements

### Grain Direction

**Critical:** Grain must run parallel to the folds (perpendicular to the strip length).

> **Common mistake:** Using paper with grain running along the strip length. This creates folds that fight the paper and never lie flat.

### Joining Paper Strips

Most paper doesn't come in 72-inch (183cm) lengths:

**Joining method:**
1. Cut strips to 6 inches (15cm) wide
2. Overlap ends by 1/2 inch (12mm)
3. Apply thin layer of paste
4. Press until dry
5. Creates continuous strip

**Hide the joins:**
- Position joins inside a fold
- They become invisible when folded
- Plan join positions before gluing

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Accordion Strip

**If using single sheet:**
1. Cut to 6 × 72 inches (15 × 183cm)
2. Verify grain runs across the 6-inch (15cm) dimension

**If joining strips:**
1. Cut multiple strips 6 inches (15cm) wide
2. Join to achieve total length
3. Allow joins to dry completely

### Step 2: Mark and Score Folds

For 12 equal panels:
1. Total length divided by 12 = panel width
2. 72 inches ÷ 12 = 6-inch (15cm) panels (creates square format)
3. Mark fold lines at every 6 inches (15cm)
4. Score each fold line with bone folder against a ruler
5. Verify all marks are straight and parallel

> **Pro tip:** Use a set square to ensure fold lines are perfectly perpendicular to the strip edges. Small errors compound across multiple folds.

![Step 2: Marking fold lines with ruler and bone folder](/images/diagrams/accordion-marking-folds.jpg)

### Step 3: Fold the Accordion

1. Begin at one end
2. Fold first score away from you (mountain fold)
3. Move to next score
4. Fold toward you (valley fold)
5. Alternate: mountain, valley, mountain, valley...
6. Continue through all folds

**Technique:**
- Fold each crease sharply with bone folder
- Verify alignment at each fold
- Stack should become neat brick shape

### Step 4: Press the Accordion

1. Stack all folds aligned
2. Place between pressing boards
3. Weight overnight
4. This sets creases permanently

## Creating the Covers

### Step 5: Cut the Boards

1. Cut two pieces of binder's board
2. Size: 6.25 × 6.25 inches (16 × 16cm)—slightly larger than accordion
3. Check both are identical
4. Sand any rough edges

> **Tool swap:** No binder's board? Glue two pieces of mat board together for similar rigidity.

### Step 6: Cover the Boards

For each cover:
1. Cut book cloth 1 inch (2.5cm) larger than board on all sides
2. Apply PVA evenly to board
3. Center board on cloth
4. Turn corners (miter cut for neatness)
5. Turn in edges, bone folder sharp
6. Press flat

**Details:**
- Work quickly before glue sets
- Press out air bubbles
- Clean edges

## Attaching Accordion to Covers

### Step 7: Prepare Endpapers

The decorative paper covers the inside of each cover and attaches the accordion.

1. Cut two pieces of decorative paper
2. Size: 5.75 × 5.75 inches (14.5 × 14.5cm)—slightly smaller than boards

### Step 8: Attach First End

1. Place front cover face down
2. Apply PVA to first accordion panel
3. Position accordion centered on cover
4. Press firmly
5. Apply PVA to endpaper
6. Position over accordion attachment
7. Covers the joint and decorates interior
8. Press and weight

**Alignment:**
- Equal margins on all sides
- Accordion should be centered
- Endpaper should be centered within cover

### Step 9: Attach Second End

1. Fold accordion to stack
2. Verify last panel is correctly oriented
3. Attach to back cover using same method
4. Be careful not to twist the accordion

> **Common mistake:** Twisting the accordion during attachment. Verify each fold alternates correctly before gluing the second cover.

## Finishing

### Step 10: Final Pressing

1. With accordion collapsed, press entire book
2. Weight overnight
3. This sets all attachments

### Step 11: Check Your Work

- [ ] All folds crisp and even
- [ ] Covers attached squarely
- [ ] Accordion opens smoothly
- [ ] Accordion closes completely flat
- [ ] No adhesive showing

## Mounting Photos

### Mounting Options

**Adhesive mounting:**
- Photo corners (archival, removable)
- Spray adhesive (permanent)
- Photo tape (clean but permanent)
- PVA (permanent, may ripple photos)

**Sleeve mounting:**
- Create paper sleeves for each panel
- Photos slide in and out
- Easiest to change

> **Pro tip:** For archival albums, always use acid-free photo corners. They allow photos to be removed without damage.

### Photo Arrangement

**Single-sided:**
- One photo per panel
- 12 photos total
- View like traditional album

**Double-sided:**
- Photos on both sides
- 24 photos total
- Must view panels individually

**Continuous panorama:**
- Extended photo strip
- Unfolds to show complete image
- Creative display option

## Design Variations

### Extended Accordion

More panels:
- Longer strip, more folds
- Consider storage (very long accordions awkward)
- Great for visual narratives

### Multiple Strips

Several accordions in one cover:
- Attach multiple accordion strips
- Creates layered effect
- Complex but dramatic

### Varied Panel Sizes

Different width panels:
- Creates rhythm and variety
- Requires careful planning
- Contemporary design approach

### Pop-Up Elements

Add dimensional pieces:
- Folds create natural pop-up opportunities
- Photos can stand at angles
- Interactive and engaging

## Display Options

Accordion books offer unique display:

**Extended on shelf:**
- Unfold partially or fully
- Freestanding when zigzagged
- Dynamic display

**In box or case:**
- Protect when not displayed
- Presentation quality
- Gift-worthy

**Framed extended:**
- Full panorama visible
- Under glass for protection
- Art object rather than book

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Accordion won't fold flat | Uneven fold widths | More precise measuring next time |
| Twisted accordion | Panels not aligned | Realign before final pressing |
| Cover won't close | Accordion attached crooked | Carefully detach and reattach |
| Folds not crisp | Insufficient scoring | More bone folder work, longer pressing |
| Photos rippling | Too much adhesive | Use photo corners or lighter adhesive |

## Historical Context

Accordion books have ancient origins:

**Asian tradition:**
- Chinese origin (possibly Tang Dynasty, 7th–10th century)
- Called orihon in Japan
- Used for sutras and calligraphy
- Continuous scroll heritage

**Western adoption:**
- European leporello (named for Don Giovanni's servant)
- Used for panoramic views
- Popular in 19th century for travel scenes

## FAQ

**How long can an accordion book be?**
Practically, 12–20 panels works well. Beyond that, the book becomes unwieldy to handle and store. For longer narratives, consider multiple volumes.

**Can I use regular printer paper?**
For practice, yes. For finished projects, use heavier stock (100+ lb / 270+ GSM) that holds crisp folds and supports photo weight.

**Do I need to cover the boards before attachment?**
Yes, cover them first. Once the accordion is attached, covering becomes very difficult.

**Can I add more panels later?**
Not easily. Plan your panel count before construction. If you need flexibility, consider a loose-leaf system instead.

**What's the best adhesive for mounting photos?**
Photo corners are safest—they're archival and allow removal. For permanent mounting, spray adhesive gives the flattest results.
