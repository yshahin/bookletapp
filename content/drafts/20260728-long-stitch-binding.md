Long stitch binding sews signatures directly to a soft cover, creating visible thread patterns on the exposed spine.

**TL;DR**
- Thread passes along the entire length of the spine, creating long visible stitches
- The cover wraps around the text block and becomes part of the sewing structure
- Excellent for journals and sketchbooks with a handcrafted aesthetic

## Understanding Long Stitch Structure

In long stitch binding:
- A single piece of flexible cover wraps around the text block
- Slots cut in the spine area allow sewing through the cover
- Thread passes through signatures and cover, creating visible stitches
- The "long stitch" refers to the visible thread running along the spine

```
Cover wraps around:
        ┌───────────────┐
        │ Back  │Spine│ Front │
        │       │═════│       │
        │       │═════│       │  ← Slots in spine
        │       │═════│       │
        │       │═════│       │
        └───────────────────────┘
```

The visible stitches become a design element.


## Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Text paper | Folded into signatures | 3-6 signatures typical |
| Cover material | Flexible - leather, heavy paper, or book cloth | Single piece |
| Thread | Waxed linen or bookbinding thread | 3x spine height per signature |
| Needle | Straight, sharp | Large eye |
| Awl | Sharp point | Piercing holes |
| Craft knife | Sharp | Cutting slots |
| Metal ruler | Straight edge | Slot cutting |
| Bone folder | Standard | Creasing |

## Preparing the Cover

The cover is a single piece that wraps around the entire book.

#### Measuring the Cover

**Width:** (2 x text block width) + spine width + 2 inches for overlap
**Height:** Text block height + 1 inch (1/2" overhang top and bottom)

For a 5" x 7" text block with 1/2" spine:
- Width: 10" + 0.5" + 2" = 12.5"
- Height: 8"

#### Cutting Spine Slots

Slots allow thread to pass through the cover:

**Slot positions:**
1. Mark spine area on inside of cover
2. Slots correspond to sewing stations in signatures
3. Typical: 4-6 stations (4-6 slots)

**Slot dimensions:**
- Length: Approximately 1/4" (6mm)
- Width: Just enough for thread to pass (1-2mm)

**Cutting slots:**
1. Mark positions carefully
2. Use craft knife with metal ruler
3. Cut just through the cover material
4. Clean up any rough edges


## Preparing Signatures

#### Folding and Pressing

1. Fold signatures (3-4 sheets each works well)
2. Press overnight
3. Stack and align

#### Creating Sewing Stations

Stations must align with cover slots:

1. Create template matching slot positions
2. Add two end stations (these don't go through slots)
3. Pierce all signatures identically

**Station arrangement:**

```
Signature fold:
│← End station (kettle stitch location)
│
○ ← Slot station 1
│
○ ← Slot station 2
│
○ ← Slot station 3
│
○ ← Slot station 4
│
│← End station (kettle stitch location)
```

## The Long Stitch Sewing Pattern

The sewing creates the characteristic long stitches on the spine.

#### Starting the Sewing

1. Position cover right side down
2. Place first signature in spine area, aligned with slots
3. Enter first signature at bottom end station from inside
4. Exit, wrap around tail edge, re-enter
5. Sew up through signature to first slot station

#### Creating Long Stitches

At each slot station:
1. Exit signature through sewing hole
2. Pass needle through cover slot from inside to outside
3. Run thread along spine (this is the "long stitch")
4. Pass through next slot from outside to inside
5. Enter signature at corresponding hole

#### Adding Signatures

1. Exit last slot station of first signature
2. Position second signature
3. Enter second signature at corresponding station
4. Sew through, exiting at slots
5. Long stitch on outside runs opposite direction

#### The Pattern Rhythm

For each signature:
1. Enter at end station
2. Sew to first slot, exit
3. Through cover slot
4. Along spine (long stitch)
5. Through next slot
6. Into signature
7. Continue pattern
8. Kettle stitch at end station
9. Begin next signature


## Sewing Variations

#### Basic Long Stitch

Single thread spans from slot to slot:
- Simplest version
- Clean parallel lines on spine
- Good for beginners

#### Packed Long Stitch

Thread wraps back on itself:
- Creates thicker lines
- More decorative
- Takes more thread

#### Cross-Hatch Pattern

Alternating direction creates X patterns:
- Thread crosses previous signature's stitch
- Very decorative
- More complex sewing

#### Link Stitch Combination

Adding link stitches between signatures:
- Extra structural connection
- Decorative addition
- Advanced technique

## Tension and Finishing

#### Tension Control

Long stitches require consistent tension:
- Too loose: Stitches sag
- Too tight: Cover buckles
- Just right: Thread lies flat against spine

**Technique:**
- Pull each stitch snug but not tight
- Check spine lies flat after each signature
- Adjust before proceeding if needed

#### Finishing the Binding

1. End with kettle stitch at final signature
2. Pass needle under several stitches
3. Create small knot
4. Trim thread close
5. Optional: dot of PVA on knot

## Cover Materials

#### Leather

Traditional choice:
- Durable and flexible
- Develops patina with use
- Requires paring at spine for flexibility

#### Heavy Paper

Accessible option:
- Cardstock or heavy decorative paper
- Scores and folds easily
- May wear at corners

#### Book Cloth

Good compromise:
- Durability of cloth
- Works like paper
- Many colors and textures available

#### Parchment/Vellum

Historical option:
- Very durable
- Distinctive appearance
- Requires special handling (humidity sensitive)

## Finishing the Cover

#### Wrap-Around Tie

Add closure with ribbon or cord:
- Attach ribbon at spine
- Wraps around to hold closed
- Functional and decorative

#### Bone Clasp

Traditional closure:
- Bone button on front
- Cord loop on back flap
- Historical appearance

#### Tuck Closure

Simplest option:
- Back flap tucks into front
- No additional hardware
- Works with longer back flap


## Design Considerations

#### Thread Color

Visible thread invites color choices:
- Contrasting: Bold statement
- Matching: Subtle texture
- Variegated: Visual interest

#### Slot Spacing

Affects pattern appearance:
- Closer spacing: More stitches, denser pattern
- Wider spacing: Longer visible stitches
- Uneven spacing: Contemporary design element

#### Cover Decoration

Consider decorating cover:
- Before sewing (keeps decoration flat)
- Stamping, painting, or printing
- Pattern placement around slots

## Practice Project: Long Stitch Journal

**Specifications:**
- 4 signatures, 3 sheets each
- A5 size (approximately 6" x 8")
- Heavy kraft paper cover
- 5 slot stations
- Waxed linen thread, contrasting color

**Process:**
1. Fold and press signatures
2. Cut and score cover
3. Cut 5 slots in spine area
4. Pierce signatures to match
5. Sew using basic long stitch pattern
6. Add wrap-around cord closure
7. Press gently if needed

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Cover buckles at spine | Tension too tight | Reduce pull on long stitches |
| Stitches don't align | Holes don't match slots | Re-pierce signatures to match |
| Cover tears at slots | Slots too small or thread too thick | Cut slots slightly larger |
| Signatures don't align | Positioning error while sewing | More care placing each signature |
| Thread fraying | Rough slot edges | Smooth edges with bone folder |

## Historical Context

Long stitch binding has roots in medieval European bookmaking. Limp vellum bindings using similar techniques protected documents for centuries. The visible sewing served practical purposes - it was easier to repair and didn't require rigid boards.

Contemporary binders have revived and expanded the technique, creating variations that serve journals, sketchbooks, and artist's books. The combination of historical connection and practical utility makes long stitch a popular structure.

## Variations to Explore

After mastering basic long stitch:

**Multiple sections:** Sewing onto tapes with long stitch elements
**Decorative tie-downs:** Crossing stitches for pattern
**Mixed structures:** Combining long stitch with other sewing methods
**Hardcover adaptation:** Long stitch through board covers
