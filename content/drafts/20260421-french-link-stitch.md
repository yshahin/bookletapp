The French link stitch combines the decorative appeal of Coptic-style exposed sewing with the structural benefits of sewing onto tapes.

**TL;DR**
- Thread links between signatures while wrapping around support tapes
- Creates visible chain pattern with added structural strength
- Ideal for sketchbooks and journals that need durability

## Understanding French Link Stitch

French link stitch differs from both simple link stitch and tape sewing:

**Combines:**
- Visible chain stitch pattern (like Coptic)
- Tape supports at sewing stations
- Strong structural connection
- Decorative exposed spine

**Results in:**
- Books that open well
- Strong, durable structure
- Beautiful spine appearance
- Appropriate for medium to heavy books

## When to Use French Link

**Ideal for:**
- Sketchbooks and journals (needs durability)
- Books receiving heavy use
- Medium to thick text blocks
- When both strength and beauty matter

> **Pro tip:** French link is excellent for travel journals and field notebooks—the tapes add durability for rough handling.

| Stitch Type | Strength | Decoration | Complexity |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Kettle stitch | Good | Hidden | Basic |
| Link stitch | Good | Visible | Intermediate |
| French link | Excellent | Visible | Intermediate |
| Coptic | Good | Very visible | Intermediate |

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Text paper | Folded signatures | Standard preparation |
| Cover boards | Book board, 1/16 inch (2mm) | If making a case |
| Tapes | Linen or cotton, 1/2 inch (12mm) wide | 2–4 depending on book size |
| Thread | Waxed linen | Medium weight |
| Needle | Curved or straight | Large eye |
| Awl | For piercing | Sharp |
| Sewing frame (optional) | For tape positioning | Helpful but not essential |

> **Budget option:** Cotton twill tape from a fabric store works well and costs less than specialty bookbinding tape.

## Preparing the Tapes

### Tape Selection

- **Linen tape:** Traditional, strong
- **Cotton tape:** More economical, good grip
- **Width:** 1/2–3/4 inch (12–20mm) typical

### Tape Quantity

Based on spine height:
- Small books (under 6 inches / 15cm): 2 tapes
- Medium books (6–9 inches / 15–23cm): 3 tapes
- Large books (over 9 inches / 23cm): 4+ tapes

### Tape Preparation

1. Cut tapes to approximately 3 inches (8cm) longer than spine width
2. Tapes will extend beyond the text block
3. Extensions later attach to boards or fold inside

## Marking and Piercing

### Station Layout

Example for 3 tapes on 8-inch (20cm) spine:

```
Head end → ────────────────── ← Kettle station (1/2 inch from edge)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 1 (2 inches from head)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 2 (4 inches - center)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 3 (6 inches from head)

Tail end → ────────────────── ← Kettle station (1/2 inch from edge)
```

**At each tape:** Pierce holes on either side (thread enters one side, exits other)

### Piercing Pattern

For each signature at each tape station:
- Two holes, straddling the tape position
- Holes approximately 3/8 inch (10mm) apart
- Tape will sit between these holes

**Total holes per signature (for 3 tapes):**
- 2 kettle stations (head and tail)
- 6 tape stations (2 per tape)
- Total: 8 holes

## Step-by-Step Sewing

### Setting Up

1. Position first signature
2. Place tapes across spine at marked positions
3. Tapes sit behind the signature
4. Hold tapes in place (sewing frame, tape, or assistant)

> **Tool swap:** No sewing frame? Tape the ends of your tapes to the work surface with masking tape. Remove and reposition as you sew.

### Sewing Signature 1

1. Enter at head kettle station from inside
2. Exit outside, wrap thread around tape 1
3. Re-enter signature on other side of tape
4. Sew inside to tape 2
5. Exit, wrap around tape 2, re-enter
6. Continue to tape 3
7. Exit, wrap around tape 3, re-enter
8. Exit at tail kettle station
9. Leave thread tail for tying

**Pattern:** The thread wraps around each tape, creating the structural connection.

### Adding Signature 2

1. Position signature 2 on top of signature 1
2. Enter at tail from outside
3. At tape 3: exit, link to signature 1 (the French link), re-enter
4. Continue through signature
5. At each tape: exit, link to previous signature, re-enter
6. At head: kettle stitch to signature 1
7. Tie to starting tail with square knot

### The French Link (The Key Technique)

The "French link" happens at each tape:

1. Thread exits signature at tape station
2. Pass needle behind the tape
3. Loop around the thread from previous signature (creating link)
4. Pass behind tape again
5. Re-enter signature on other side of tape

This creates the chain pattern visible on the spine.

```
     Sig 2 thread
         │
         │ ╭──○──╮  ← Link loop
    ═════╪═══════╪═════ ← Tape
         │       │
         │ ╰──●──╯  ← Thread from Sig 1
         │
```

> **Common mistake:** Forgetting to pass behind the tape twice. The thread must go behind the tape, form the link, then pass behind the tape again before re-entering.

### Continuing the Pattern

For each subsequent signature:
1. Enter at the end where previous exited
2. At each tape: French link to previous signature
3. Kettle stitch at spine ends
4. Build up chain pattern at tapes

## Board Attachment Options

The tape extensions allow several attachment methods:

### Laced-In Boards

Traditional method:
1. Cut slots in boards for tapes
2. Thread tapes through slots
3. Fray and paste down tape ends
4. Cover with pastedown

Strong, historical, clean appearance.

### Adhered Tapes

Simpler method:
1. Paste tape extensions to inside of boards
2. Cover with pastedown
3. Functional but less refined

### Exposed Tapes

Contemporary option:
1. Leave tapes visible
2. Creates design feature
3. Industrial or artistic aesthetic

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Links uneven | Inconsistent technique | Practice, develop rhythm |
| Tapes shifting | Not secured well | Better initial attachment |
| Tension inconsistent | Variable pulling | Focus on even tension |
| Forgetting links | Complex pattern | Count stations systematically |
| Holes tearing | Too close to edge | Increase margins to 1/2 inch (12mm) |

### Tips for Success

**Tape Management:**
- Secure tapes well before starting
- A sewing frame makes this easier
- Or use small pieces of masking tape to hold in place

**Thread Tension:**
- Snug but not tight
- Tapes should stay centered
- Links should lie flat

**Rhythm:**
- Develop a consistent motion
- Count stations to avoid missing links
- Take time with first few signatures

> **Pro tip:** Say the pattern aloud as you sew: "Exit, behind tape, link, behind tape, enter." This prevents mistakes.

## Variations

### Single Link

Simplified version:
- Link only to adjacent signature (not through previous chain)
- Easier but less decorative

### Colored Thread

Design element:
- Contrasting thread highlights the chain
- Multiple colors possible
- Decorative emphasis

### Combined with Other Structures

French link can combine with:
- Exposed spine covers
- Limp bindings
- Case bindings (tapes hidden inside)

## Glossary

- **French link:** The looping connection formed at each tape station between signatures
- **Kettle stitch:** The linking stitch at head and tail that joins signatures at the spine ends
- **Sewing station:** A hole position through which the needle and thread pass
- **Tape:** Woven strip providing structural support perpendicular to the spine
- **Laced-in boards:** Board attachment where tapes pass through slots cut in the cover

## FAQ

**How is French link different from regular tape sewing?**
In regular tape sewing, you simply wrap around the tape. French link adds a loop connecting to the previous signature, creating the visible chain pattern.

**Can I use ribbons instead of tape?**
Ribbon is weaker than woven tape. For decorative books that won't see heavy use, it works. For journals, stick with linen or cotton tape.

**Do I need a sewing frame?**
No, but it helps significantly. Without one, tape your tape ends to the table and work carefully to keep them positioned.

**How many signatures can I sew with one length of thread?**
Approximately 4–6 signatures depending on spine height. Join new thread with a reef knot inside a signature and continue.

**Can I combine French link with Coptic-style covers?**
Yes. Use French link for the signatures, then attach covers with the tape extensions or with Coptic-style board holes—a hybrid approach that's very strong.
