Every bookbinder must understand adhesives.

**TL;DR**
- PVA is permanent, fast-drying, and best for building new books
- Wheat paste is reversible, slow-drying, and essential for conservation work
- Mix them together (1:1 ratio) for a versatile general-purpose adhesive

## PVA: The Modern Standard

PVA is a synthetic polymer adhesive—the white glue you probably already know. In bookbinding, we use archival-quality PVA, which is pH-neutral and won't yellow or become brittle over time.

### Properties of PVA

- **Dries quickly:** Sets in minutes, fully cures in 24 hours
- **Dries clear:** Becomes transparent when dry
- **Flexible when dry:** Won't crack with book movement
- **Strong bond:** Creates a permanent, non-reversible bond
- **Waterproof when cured:** Resistant to moisture

### Best Uses for PVA

- Gluing spine linings
- Attaching endpapers
- Adhering book cloth to boards
- Any application requiring quick setting time
- Projects where reversibility isn't needed

> **Pro tip:** Thin PVA slightly with water (10:1 ratio) for better penetration into paper fibers. This helps prevent thick spots that dry lumpy.

## Wheat Paste: The Traditional Choice

Wheat paste (also called wheat starch paste) is made by cooking wheat starch in water. It's been used for centuries and remains essential for conservation work.

### Properties of Wheat Paste

- **Slow drying:** Gives you extended working time—15 to 30 minutes
- **Reversible:** Can be reactivated with water
- **Minimal warping:** High water content but dries without distortion
- **Archival:** Completely stable over centuries
- **Adjustable consistency:** Can be thinned or thickened as needed

### Best Uses for Wheat Paste

- Leather paring and turn-ins
- Paper repairs and conservation
- Lining fragile materials
- Any work requiring repositioning
- Historical restoration where reversibility is essential

> **Budget option:** Make your own wheat paste from wheat starch powder and water. Commercial paste is convenient but homemade works identically.

## The Chemistry Explained

### Why PVA Bonds Permanently

PVA works through mechanical adhesion. As the water in PVA evaporates, the polymer chains physically interlock with the paper fibers. Once dry, these chains are locked together permanently. Adding water won't reverse this—you'd need solvents to break the bonds.

### Why Wheat Paste is Reversible

Wheat paste bonds through hydrogen bonding between starch molecules and cellulose fibers. These bonds are strong but can be broken by reintroducing water, which allows the starch to re-swell and release from the paper fibers.

## Mixing Adhesives: The Hybrid Approach

Many bookbinders mix PVA and wheat paste to get properties of both:

| Ratio (PVA : Paste) | Properties | Use Case |
|---------------------|------------|----------|
| 1:1 | Balanced working time and strength | General purpose work |
| 1:3 | Extended working time, some permanence | Leather work |
| 3:1 | Quick tack with slight repositioning | Cover work |

> **Pro tip:** Mix in small batches. The hybrid mixture has a shorter working life than either component alone.

## Practical Tips

### Working with PVA

1. **Apply in thin, even coats**—thick layers wrinkle paper and take longer to dry
2. **Work quickly** once applied; you have 2–3 minutes before it starts setting
3. **Keep a damp sponge nearby** to wipe excess from fingers and tools
4. **Store with lid tight**; it skins over rapidly when exposed to air

> **Tool swap:** No glue brush? A piece of mat board cut to 1 inch (2.5cm) wide spreads PVA evenly. Discard when gunky.

### Working with Wheat Paste

1. **Cook thoroughly**—undercooked paste is weak and grainy
2. **Strain through a sieve** to remove lumps before using
3. **Apply with a brush** in consistent, overlapping strokes
4. **Make fresh batches**; refrigerated paste lasts only 3–5 days before molding

## Which Should You Use?

**Choose PVA when:**

- Speed matters
- You need a permanent bond
- Working with book cloth or cover materials
- Building new books

**Choose Wheat Paste when:**

- Working with delicate papers
- Doing conservation or repair
- You need time to adjust positioning
- Working with leather

**Choose a Mixture when:**

- You want moderate working time with decent strength
- You're uncertain which pure adhesive is best
- You need some repositionability but not full reversibility

## Common Mistakes

> **Common mistake:** Too much PVA creates waves and wrinkles in paper. Apply thin coats and press immediately under weight.

> **Common mistake:** Undercooked paste results in weak, chalky bonds. The mixture should be smooth and translucent, not gritty.

> **Common mistake:** Using PVA on antique repairs destroys future conservation options. Always use reversible paste for historical materials.

## Safety Notes

Both PVA and wheat paste are non-toxic and safe to handle. However:

- **Wash hands after use**—dried adhesive is uncomfortable
- **Keep containers closed**—PVA skins form quickly and contaminate the batch
- **Dispose of old paste**—moldy wheat paste should be discarded, not used
- **Ventilation is helpful** when working with large amounts of wet adhesive

Understanding adhesives is understanding bookbinding itself. The right glue, applied correctly, is invisible in the finished work.

## Glossary

- **PVA:** Polyvinyl acetate, a synthetic polymer adhesive that forms permanent bonds
- **Wheat paste:** A reversible adhesive made from cooked wheat starch
- **Reversibility:** The ability to undo an adhesive bond with water or other means
- **Working time:** The period during which an adhesive remains movable before setting
- **Archival:** Materials stable enough to last centuries without degradation

## FAQ

**Is school glue the same as bookbinding PVA?**
No. School glue contains additives that reduce archival quality. Bookbinding PVA is pH-neutral and designed to remain flexible permanently.

**How long does wheat paste last in the refrigerator?**
Three to five days maximum. If it develops mold or an off smell, discard it and make fresh paste.

**Can I use a mixture of PVA and paste for everything?**
For most general bookbinding, yes. Avoid it for conservation work (use pure paste) or when you need maximum strength quickly (use pure PVA).

**Why does my paper wrinkle when I apply PVA?**
You're using too much. Apply a thin, even coat and press the work under weight immediately while drying.

**Is there an alternative to wheat paste?**
Methyl cellulose is another reversible adhesive used in conservation. Rice paste is also traditional, though harder to find and prepare.
