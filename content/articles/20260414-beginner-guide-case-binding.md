Case binding is the standard method for creating hardcover books.

**TL;DR**
- The case (cover) and text block are built separately, then joined
- Accurate measurement is critical—squares should be 1/8 inch (3mm) on all edges
- The endpapers glue the text block into the finished case

## Understanding the Two Components

Unlike other binding methods where the cover attaches directly to the pages, case binding creates the cover (the "case") separately from the text block, then joins them together. This separation is the key to understanding how hardcover books work.

### The Text Block

This is the book's interior—all the pages sewn or glued together. The text block is complete before you even start making the cover. It has its own spine, endpapers, and structure.

### The Case

The case is the hardcover shell. It consists of two boards (front and back covers) and a spine piece, all wrapped in covering material like book cloth or paper. The case is built flat, then attached to the text block.

> **Pro tip:** Build the case slightly larger than the text block. The overhang (called "squares") protects the page edges from damage.

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Purpose | Specifications |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Binder's board | Cover boards | 1/16–1/8 inch (2–3mm) thick greyboard or davey board |
| Book cloth or paper | Covering | Enough to wrap with 3/4 inch (20mm) turn-ins |
| PVA glue | Adhesive | Archival quality |
| Text weight paper | Pages | 80–100 GSM |
| Endpaper stock | Connects text to case | Slightly heavier than text pages |
| Bone folder | Creasing and pressing | Teflon or traditional bone |
| Metal ruler and craft knife | Cutting | Cork-backed ruler, fresh blades |
| Pressing boards and weights | Drying | 10–20 lbs (5–10 kg) total |

> **Budget option:** For practice, use chipboard from cereal boxes instead of binder's board. It's less stable but functional for learning.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Text Block

Before making the case, your text block must be complete:

1. Fold your paper into signatures (groups of nested sheets)
2. Sew the signatures together using a kettle stitch or similar method
3. Glue the spine with PVA and let it dry
4. Attach endpapers to the first and last signatures

The text block should be pressed flat and the spine should be firm but flexible.

![Step 1: Completed text block with endpapers attached](/images/diagrams/case-binding-textblock.jpg)

> **Common mistake:** Rushing the spine glue. Let it dry fully before proceeding—at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

### Step 2: Measure for the Case

Accurate measurement is critical. You need three dimensions:

| Dimension | How to Calculate | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Board height** | Text block height + 1/4 inch (6mm) | 9 inch block → 9.25 inch board |
| **Board width** | Text block width + 1/8 inch (3mm) | 6 inch block → 6.125 inch board |
| **Spine width** | Measure with calipers while pressed | Varies by thickness |

The extra 1/4 inch (6mm) height creates 1/8 inch (3mm) squares at head and tail. The extra 1/8 inch (3mm) width creates the fore-edge square.

### Step 3: Cut the Boards

Cut two cover boards to the height and width you calculated. Cut the spine piece to the same height, but only as wide as your spine measurement.

> **Pro tip:** Always cut boards with the grain running head to tail (parallel to the spine). This prevents warping when moisture from glue is introduced.

**Cutting thick board:**

1. Score with a craft knife—don't try to cut through in one pass
2. Make 4–6 passes, each slightly deeper
3. Final cuts should be clean without ragged edges

### Step 4: Build the Case

1. Cut your covering material 3/4 inch (20mm) larger than the total spread of your boards on all sides
2. Lay out the boards on the covering material with even gaps between them—about 1/4–5/16 inch (6–8mm) between each board and the spine piece
3. Apply PVA to the covering material using smooth, even strokes
4. Position the boards and spine piece, checking alignment
5. Turn in the edges, starting with the top and bottom, then the sides
6. Rub down firmly with a bone folder, working out any air bubbles

Let the case dry under weight for at least one hour.

> **Common mistake:** Gaps that are too narrow prevent the cover from opening smoothly. Gaps too wide create a floppy hinge. The gap should roughly equal the board thickness.

### Step 5: Case In (Attaching the Text Block)

This is where the two components become one book:

1. Apply PVA evenly across the entire surface of the first endpaper (the paste-down)
2. Position the text block on the front board, ensuring even squares—1/8 inch (3mm)—on all three exposed sides
3. Close the cover and flip the book over carefully
4. Repeat with the back endpaper
5. Place the book between pressing boards and add weight

> **Pro tip:** Work quickly but carefully. PVA starts setting within minutes. Have your positioning planned before applying glue.

Let the book dry under pressure for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Uneven squares | Measurement error | Measure twice, cut once. Check alignment before pressing |
| Wet text block | Too much PVA | Apply thinner coats. Glue should not soak through endpaper |
| Warped boards | Wrong grain direction | Always verify grain runs head to tail before cutting |
| Gaps at the hinge | Spine piece too narrow | Gap between board and spine must accommodate text block shoulder |
| Cover won't open smoothly | Gaps too narrow | Increase gap between boards and spine piece |

> **Tool swap:** If you don't have pressing boards, use cutting mats or smooth plywood scraps. Any flat, rigid, non-stick surface works.

## Practice Project

Start with a simple single-signature notebook to understand the process before attempting a full sewn text block. Use lightweight materials and accept that your first few attempts are learning experiences.

**Beginner practice dimensions:**

- Text block: 5.5 × 8.5 inches (14 × 22cm), 16 pages
- Boards: 1/16 inch (2mm) chipboard
- Covering: Decorative paper

Case binding becomes intuitive with practice. Once you understand that the cover and text block are independent units that come together at the end, the entire process makes sense.

## Glossary

- **Case:** The hardcover shell made of boards wrapped in covering material
- **Text block:** The sewn or glued pages of a book before attachment to the case
- **Squares:** The overhang of cover boards beyond the text block edges
- **Turn-ins:** The covering material folded over board edges to the inside
- **Casing in:** The process of gluing the text block into the finished case

## FAQ

**What's the difference between case binding and other hardcover methods?**
In case binding, the cover is built separately and attached at the end. In other methods like laced-in boards, the boards attach directly during sewing.

**How do I know if my gaps are the right size?**
The gap between board and spine piece should roughly equal the board thickness. Test by closing the case—it should fold naturally without bunching.

**Why do my covers warp after casing in?**
Usually grain direction. Both boards and covering material must have grain running head to tail. Moisture from PVA swells fibers; wrong grain causes uneven tension.

**Can I use regular cardboard instead of binder's board?**
For practice, yes. For finished projects, binder's board is denser and more dimensionally stable. Cardboard absorbs more moisture and warps more easily.

**How long should I press the finished book?**
Minimum 4 hours, ideally overnight. Rushing the drying causes warping and weak bonds.
