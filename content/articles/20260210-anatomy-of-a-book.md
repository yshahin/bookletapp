Before you can make a book, you need to understand how books are built.

**TL;DR**
- The text block (pages) and case (cover) are separate components joined by endpapers
- Grain direction must run head-to-tail in all materials
- Standard squares (board overhang) are 1/8 inch (3mm) on three sides

## The Text Block

The text block is the body of the book—all the pages gathered and bound together. It has its own anatomy:

### Signatures (Sections)

A signature is a group of nested sheets folded together. Most books are made of multiple signatures sewn through their folds. Common signature sizes:

- **4-page (folio):** One sheet folded once
- **8-page (quarto):** One sheet folded twice
- **16-page (octavo):** One sheet folded three times

### Head, Tail, and Fore Edge

- **Head:** The top edge of the book
- **Tail:** The bottom edge
- **Fore edge:** The front edge opposite the spine

These terms apply to both the text block and the finished book.

### The Spine

The spine is where all signatures connect. In a sewn book, you'll see the stitching pattern here. The spine can be:

- **Flat:** Pages stack straight up
- **Rounded:** Pages fan out in a gentle curve
- **Backed:** Rounded with shoulders formed at the hinges

> **Pro tip:** A rounded and backed spine distributes weight more evenly, which is why most hardcover novels use this construction.

## The Case (Cover)

In hardcover books, the case is the rigid shell that protects the text block.

### Boards

The front and back covers are made of binder's board—a dense, stable cardboard. Board thickness varies:

- **1/16 inch (2mm):** Light books, journals
- **3/32 inch (2.5mm):** Standard books
- **1/8 inch (3mm+):** Large, heavy books

> **Budget option:** Chipboard from cereal boxes works for practice projects, though it's less stable than proper binder's board.

### Spine Piece

The spine piece bridges the two boards. It can be:

- **Hollow:** A tube that doesn't touch the text block spine
- **Tight:** Adhered directly to the text block spine

Most modern case bindings use hollow backs for better opening.

### Covering Material

The material wrapped around the boards:

- **Book cloth:** Woven fabric backed with paper
- **Buckram:** Heavily sized, durable cloth
- **Leather:** Full, half, or quarter coverage
- **Decorative paper:** Often used with cloth spine

## The Junction Points

Where the text block meets the case, several critical elements come together:

### Squares

The squares are the overhang of the boards beyond the text block edges. Standard squares are 1/8 inch (3mm) on three sides (head, tail, fore edge). Squares protect the pages from damage.

      The part of the Board that
      visibly overlaps the Text Block
      is called the 'Square'.

      It protects the pages.

```

### Hinges and Joints

These terms are often confused:

- **Hinge:** The flexible area between the board and spine piece (on the case)
- **Joint:** The groove where the text block shoulder meets the case

The hinge allows the cover to open; the joint is the visible line on the outside.

> **Common mistake:** Using "hinge" and "joint" interchangeably. The hinge is inside (functional), the joint is outside (visible).

### Turn-ins

The covering material folded over the board edges to the inside. Standard turn-in width is 5/8–3/4 inch (15–20mm).

## The Endpapers

Endpapers connect the text block to the case and provide a finished interior.

### Components

- **Paste-down:** The half adhered to the inside of the board
- **Flyleaf:** The free half that faces the first page of text

### Types of Endpapers

- **Single folio:** One folded sheet, simple but weak
- **Made endpaper:** Multi-section construction for strength
- **Tipped-on:** Endpaper glued to the text block edge

![Step 3: Endpaper diagram showing paste-down and flyleaf positions](/images/diagrams/endpaper-anatomy.svg)

## Decorative Elements

### Headbands

Fabric bands at the head and tail of the spine. Originally structural (for pulling books off shelves), now mostly decorative.

- **Stuck-on:** Pre-made ribbon glued in place
- **Sewn:** Traditional, worked with thread around a core

> **Tool swap:** If you don't have headband material, embroidery thread wrapped around a thin cord creates a similar effect.

### Edge Decoration

The three edges of the text block can be:

- **Plain:** Untreated
- **Colored:** Sprayed or brushed with acrylic
- **Gilt:** Covered in gold leaf
- **Marbled:** Dipped in a marbling bath

## Putting It All Together

Here's how all the parts relate spatially:

         ↑ SQUARES (overhang)
```

## Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy helps you:

1. **Diagnose problems:** If a book won't open flat, you know to check the spine construction
2. **Plan projects:** Know what materials you need before starting
3. **Communicate:** Use proper terms when seeking advice
4. **Appreciate craftsmanship:** Recognize quality in the books you encounter

Every book you make or repair becomes clearer once you can name and understand its parts.

## Glossary

- **Signature:** A group of nested, folded sheets that form a section of the book
- **Square:** The overhang of the cover boards beyond the text block edges
- **Paste-down:** The portion of the endpaper glued to the inside of the cover board
- **Hinge:** The flexible interior junction between the spine and cover boards
- **Folio:** A single sheet folded once, creating 4 pages

## FAQ

**What's the difference between a hinge and a joint?**
The hinge is the flexible area inside the cover where the board meets the spine piece. The joint is the visible groove on the outside where the cover opens.

**Why do boards need to overhang the text block?**
Squares protect the page edges from damage when the book is handled or stored. Without them, pages would be exposed and prone to wear.

**Can I use cardboard instead of binder's board?**
For practice projects, yes. However, regular cardboard warps more easily with moisture from adhesives. Binder's board is denser and more dimensionally stable.

**What grain direction should materials have?**
All materials—paper, board, cloth, endpapers—must have grain running parallel to the spine (head to tail). This prevents warping and ensures smooth opening.

**How thick should endpapers be?**
Endpapers are typically slightly heavier than text pages—around 100–140 GSM works well for most books.
