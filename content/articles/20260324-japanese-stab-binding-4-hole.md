Japanese stab binding refers to a family of side-sewn bindings where thread passes through holes along the spine edge.

**TL;DR**
- The 4-hole pattern (Yotsume Toji) is the foundation of all Japanese stab bindings
- Thread wraps around the spine, head, and tail edges in a systematic pattern
- Pages don't open flat—this binding works best for single-sided printing

## History and Characteristics

Stab binding originated in China and spread throughout East Asia. Unlike Western bindings that sew through the fold, stab binding sews through stacked flat pages near the spine edge.

**Key characteristics:**

- Pages don't open flat (limited opening angle of about 90°)
- Single-sided printing only (or accepts minor show-through)
- Decorative, exposed stitching
- No adhesives required
- Simple materials: just paper, thread, needle

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Text paper | 20–30 sheets | Medium weight, grain parallel to spine |
| Cover paper | 2 sheets | Heavier stock, same grain direction |
| Thread | 4× spine length | Silk, linen, or embroidery floss |
| Needle | 1 | Sharp, large eye |
| Awl | 1 | For piercing holes |
| Bone folder | 1 | For creasing corners |
| Ruler | 1 | For measuring |
| Pencil | 1 | For marking |
| Clips | 4–6 | Binder clips to hold pages |

> **Budget option:** Embroidery floss works well and comes in many colors. Avoid stretchy threads like cotton sewing thread.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Pages

1. **Cut all pages to the same size**—for example, 6 × 9 inches (15 × 23cm)
2. **Check grain direction**—grain must run parallel to the spine (along the 9-inch/23cm dimension)
3. **Stack pages neatly** with covers on top and bottom
4. **Tap edges on table** to align perfectly
5. **Clip the fore edge** to hold everything together

### Step 2: Mark the Holes

Japanese stab binding uses specific proportions. For a standard 4-hole pattern:

**Spine margin:** The distance from the edge to the holes—typically 3/8–5/8 inch (10–15mm)

**Hole spacing:** Divide the remaining spine length into equal sections

**Standard layout:**

1. Mark a line parallel to the spine at your chosen margin—for example, 1/2 inch (12mm) from edge
2. Measure the spine height
3. Mark the first hole 5/8 inch (15mm) from the head
4. Mark the fourth hole 5/8 inch (15mm) from the tail
5. Divide the remaining space into three equal parts for holes 2 and 3

```
HEAD
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ •  ← Hole 1 (5/8 inch from top)
  │    │
  │ •  ← Hole 2
  │    │ (equal spacing)
  │ •  ← Hole 3
  │    │
  │ •  ← Hole 4 (5/8 inch from bottom)
  └─────────────────────┘
TAIL
  ↑
  1/2 inch from spine edge
```

> **Pro tip:** For a 9-inch (23cm) spine with 5/8-inch (15mm) margins top and bottom, you have about 7.75 inches (20cm) to divide. Space holes roughly 2.6 inches (6.5cm) apart.

### Step 3: Pierce the Holes

1. Place the book block on a soft surface (cardboard, magazine)
2. Hold firmly with clips still attached
3. Use the awl to pierce straight through at each marked point
4. Push from front to back
5. Wiggle slightly to widen holes for the needle

> **Tool swap:** A sturdy pushpin or compass point works if you don't have an awl. Push through into a piece of corrugated cardboard.

**Punching on scrap cardboard gives cleaner exit holes.**

### Step 4: Thread the Needle

Cut thread approximately **4 times the spine length**:
- If spine is 9 inches (23cm), cut 36 inches (90cm) of thread
- Thread the needle
- Do **not** knot the end—leave a tail for tying

### Step 5: The 4-Hole Sewing Pattern

The Yotsume Toji pattern wraps thread around the spine and through each hole systematically.

**Starting position:** Begin at Hole 1, entering from the back

#### The Sewing Sequence

**Part 1: Initial pass (back to front)**

1. Enter **Hole 1** from back, leaving a 4-inch (10cm) tail
2. Wrap around the **head edge** and re-enter **Hole 1** from back
3. Exit **Hole 2** (front)
4. Enter **Hole 3** from front
5. Exit **Hole 4** (back)
6. Wrap around the **tail edge** and re-enter **Hole 4** from back
7. Exit **Hole 4** (front)

**Part 2: Return pass (front to back)**

8. Enter **Hole 3** from front
9. Exit **Hole 2** (back)
10. Enter **Hole 1** from back
11. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 1
12. Enter **Hole 2** from front
13. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 2
14. Enter **Hole 3** from back
15. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 3
16. Enter **Hole 4** from front
17. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 4
18. Enter **Hole 3** from back

**Finishing:**

19. Exit **Hole 3** next to the starting tail
20. Tie a square knot with both thread ends
21. Trim tails to about 1/4 inch (5mm)
22. Tuck knot under a stitch to hide

> **Common mistake:** Losing track of the pattern. Mark holes with numbers 1–4 and check off each step as you complete it.

### What the Pattern Looks Like

**Front cover:**
- Vertical stitches connecting all four holes
- Corner wraps at head and tail

**Spine edge:**
- Individual horizontal wraps at each hole

**Back cover:**
- Diagonal stitches creating an X pattern between holes

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Loose stitches | Not enough tension | Pull snug after each pass |
| Thread tangling | Thread too long | Use shorter thread, join with reef knot |
| Uneven holes | Inconsistent awl angle | Pierce straight through |
| Pages shifting | Not clipped properly | Use more clips during sewing |
| Can't find hole | Lost track of pattern | Mark holes with numbers |

## Variations to Explore

Once you've mastered the 4-hole pattern, try these variations:

### Tortoise Shell (Kikko Toji)

A 6-hole pattern that creates a decorative zigzag effect.

### Hemp Leaf (Asa no Ha Toji)

Complex pattern resembling hemp leaves—advanced but stunning.

### Noble (Koki Toji)

Adds extra wrapping for a more elaborate spine.

## Design Considerations

**Thread color:**
- Contrasting thread makes stitching a design feature
- Matching thread creates a subtle, elegant look
- Variegated thread adds visual interest

**Paper choice:**
- Thinner paper = more pages possible
- Japanese papers (washi) are traditional but not required
- Maximum practical thickness: about 30 sheets

**Cover materials:**
- Decorative paper
- Book cloth
- Leather (pierce carefully with a sharp awl)
- Traditional Japanese covers often use patterned paper

> **Pro tip:** For a traditional look, fold the cover paper edges inward so raw edges are hidden. This requires slightly larger cover sheets.

## Practical Uses

Japanese stab bindings work well for:

- Photo albums (single-sided inserts)
- Guest books
- Sketchbooks
- Menus or catalogs
- Art portfolios
- Journals (accept limited opening)

## Care for Stab-Bound Books

- Store upright or flat—not leaning at an angle
- Handle by the boards, not the thread
- The spine is decorative—avoid catching threads on objects

The 4-hole Yotsume Toji is your gateway to Japanese bookbinding. Master this pattern, and the more complex variations become simple extensions of the same logic.

## Glossary

- **Yotsume Toji:** The Japanese term for 4-hole stab binding (四つ目綴じ)
- **Stab binding:** Any side-sewn binding where thread passes through flat, stacked pages
- **Spine margin:** The distance from the spine edge to the row of sewing holes
- **Washi:** Traditional Japanese paper made from plant fibers
- **Fore edge:** The front edge of the book, opposite the spine

## FAQ

**Why don't the pages open flat?**
Because the sewing holes are near the spine edge, not through a fold. Opening the book bends the pages at the binding line, limiting the angle.

**Can I use this binding for a book with text on both sides?**
Only if the text is positioned away from the spine margin. The inner 1/2–3/4 inch (12–20mm) near the spine is difficult to read.

**How many pages is too many for stab binding?**
Beyond 30 sheets, the book becomes very thick and the spine edge wraps are harder to tension evenly. For more pages, consider multiple volumes.

**What's the best thread for beginners?**
Waxed linen or silk embroidery thread. Both are strong, slide smoothly through holes, and come in many colors.

**Do I need special Japanese paper?**
No. Any paper with grain running parallel to the spine works. Washi is traditional and beautiful but not required.
