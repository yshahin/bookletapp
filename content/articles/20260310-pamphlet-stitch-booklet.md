The pamphlet stitch is the simplest form of bookbinding.

**TL;DR**
- A three-hole stitch creates a sturdy 16-page notebook
- You need only paper, thread, needle, and basic tools
- This technique teaches folding, piercing, and sewing—skills used in all binding

## What You'll Make

A 16-page (8-leaf) soft cover notebook, approximately 5.8 × 8.3 inches (A5 size), with a three-hole pamphlet stitch binding. Perfect for notes, sketches, or as a gift.

## Tools & Materials

| Material | Quantity | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Text weight paper | 4 sheets | 8.3 × 11.7 inch (A4) size, 80–100 GSM |
| Cover stock | 1 sheet | 8.3 × 11.7 inch (A4) size, 160–200 GSM |
| Linen thread | 20 inches (50cm) | Waxed preferred |
| Needle | 1 | Large eye, sharp point |
| Bone folder | 1 | For creasing |
| Awl | 1 | For piercing holes |
| Ruler | 1 | For measuring |
| Pencil | 1 | For marking |

> **Budget option:** No awl? A large needle or thumbtack works for piercing. No waxed thread? Run regular linen thread over a candle or beeswax.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Text Pages

Take your four sheets of text paper:

1. Stack them precisely, edges aligned
2. Fold the stack in half, bringing the short edges together
3. Crease firmly with the bone folder, sweeping from center outward
4. This creates your **signature**—a nested set of folded pages

You now have 16 pages (4 sheets × 2 sides × 2 leaves per fold = 16 pages).

### Step 2: Prepare the Cover

Take the cover stock:

1. Fold it in half the same way as the text pages
2. Crease firmly
3. The cover will wrap around your signature

> **Pro tip:** Trim the cover slightly larger than the text pages—about 1/8 inch (2–3mm) on head, tail, and fore edge—for a professional look with protective overhang.

### Step 3: Mark the Sewing Stations

Open the cover and text block flat. You'll mark three holes along the fold:

1. **Center hole:** Find the exact middle of the spine
2. **Head hole:** 3/4–1 inch (2–3cm) from the top edge
3. **Tail hole:** 3/4–1 inch (2–3cm) from the bottom edge

Mark with a pencil on the inside of the fold. Ensure marks are on the fold line itself.

```
HEAD EDGE
    •  ← Head hole (3/4–1 inch from edge)
    |
    |
    •  ← Center hole (exact middle)
    |
    |
    •  ← Tail hole (3/4–1 inch from edge)
TAIL EDGE
```

### Step 4: Pierce the Holes

Place the text block inside the cover:

1. Open to the center fold
2. Rest the spine on a soft surface (magazine or cardboard)
3. Use the awl to pierce through all layers at each mark
4. Push the awl from the inside out
5. Wiggle slightly to enlarge the hole for the needle

Pierce all three holes through both the cover and text pages simultaneously.

> **Common mistake:** Piercing cover and pages separately causes misaligned holes. Always pierce through all layers together.

### Step 5: Thread the Needle

Cut approximately 20 inches (50cm) of thread:

1. Thread the needle
2. Do **not** knot the end—you need both tails free

If using unwaxed thread, run it over beeswax now for smoother sewing.

### Step 6: The Pamphlet Stitch

This is a three-hole stitch. Work from inside the signature:

**Starting from inside:**

1. Enter the **center hole** from inside, pulling thread through until about 4 inches (10cm) remains inside
2. Exit through the center hole, leaving the tail inside

**Sewing pattern:**

3. Enter the **tail hole** from outside
4. Exit through the **head hole** from inside
5. Enter the **center hole** from outside

**Finishing:**

6. Your thread should now exit next to the starting tail
7. Make sure the thread wraps around the long stitch connecting head to tail holes
8. Tie a square knot with the two thread ends

> **Pro tip:** Before tying, pull both thread ends to snug up the stitches. The binding should be firm but not so tight it puckers.

### Step 7: Trim and Finish

With the stitch complete:

1. Trim thread tails to about 3/8 inch (1cm)
2. Close the book and press under weight for 10–15 minutes
3. If desired, trim the fore edge with a knife and ruler for a cleaner look

## The Completed Stitch Pattern

When done correctly, you should see:

**Outside spine:**

- One long stitch from head hole to tail hole
- One short stitch crossing the center

**Inside spine:**

- Two diagonal stitches meeting at center
- A knot at the center hole

## Tips & Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pages falling out | Thread too loose | Pull snug before knotting |
| Cover won't close flat | Holes not aligned | Repierce through all layers together |
| Thread breaks | Over-tensioned or weak thread | Use waxed thread, pull gently |
| Spine puckers | Thread too tight | Maintain even, moderate tension |

> **Tool swap:** If your needle is too thick for the holes, use a smaller needle or widen holes with the awl.

## Variations to Try

Once you've mastered the basic three-hole pamphlet:

### Five-Hole Pamphlet

Add two more holes between the center and end holes. The pattern is longer but follows the same logic: enter center, work outward, return to center.

### Decorative Stitch

Use colored thread for a visible design element. Try contrasting colors or variegated thread.

### Multiple Signatures

Stack 2–3 signatures together (nest them or sew separately), and you have a thicker notebook. This transitions toward multi-signature sewing with kettle stitch.

## What You've Learned

This simple project teaches skills used in all bookbinding:

- **Folding accurately:** Creating clean signatures
- **Piercing holes:** Consistent, aligned stations
- **Sewing tension:** Not too tight, not too loose
- **Finishing:** Trimming and pressing

The pamphlet stitch is the foundation. Every complex binding builds on these basic principles of folding, piercing, and sewing.

## Glossary

- **Signature:** A group of nested, folded sheets sewn together as a unit
- **Sewing station:** A hole through which the needle and thread pass
- **Kettle stitch:** A linking stitch used to connect multiple signatures
- **Fore edge:** The front edge of the book, opposite the spine
- **Square knot:** A flat, secure knot that won't slip (right over left, then left over right)

## FAQ

**How many pages can a single pamphlet hold?**
Practically, 24–32 pages (6–8 sheets) before the fold becomes too thick. For more pages, use multiple signatures sewn together.

**Do I need to use a cover?**
No. You can sew a pamphlet with just text pages, though a cover protects the binding and looks more finished.

**Why waxed thread?**
Wax reduces friction, making the thread slide smoothly through holes. It also adds slight stiffness that helps prevent tangling.

**Can I use different paper for each section?**
Yes. Pamphlets work well with mixed papers—sketch paper, lined paper, and blank pages in one notebook.

**What if my holes tear through the fold?**
This happens when holes are too close to the edge or paper is too thin. Keep holes at least 1/2 inch (12mm) from head and tail edges, and use paper with good fiber strength.
