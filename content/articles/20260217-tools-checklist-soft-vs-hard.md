The tools you need depend on what you're making.

**TL;DR**
- Start with six basics: bone folder, ruler, knife, mat, needle, and thread
- Soft cover binding needs minimal investment; hardcover adds pressing equipment
- Buy quality basics first; specialty tools can wait until projects demand them

## Universal Tools (Always Needed)

These tools are used in virtually every binding project:

### Bone Folder

A smooth, flat tool for creasing paper and rubbing down glued surfaces. Every bookbinder needs at least one.

- **Teflon folders:** Won't leave marks on dark paper
- **Traditional bone:** Classic choice, develops a patina

> **Budget option:** A butter knife with rounded edges works in a pinch, though dedicated folders give cleaner creases.

### Metal Ruler

A straight edge for measuring and cutting. Steel is essential—plastic and wood get nicked by blades.

- **18 inches (45cm):** Good all-purpose size
- **Cork backing:** Prevents slipping

### Craft Knife

For precision cutting. X-Acto style or Stanley knife both work.

- **Replace blades often:** Dull blades tear paper
- **Keep several handles:** One for heavy cuts, one for delicate work

> **Pro tip:** Change your blade every 20–30 cuts on paper. A dull blade causes more injuries than a sharp one because you push harder.

### Cutting Mat

Self-healing mats protect your work surface and blades.

- **A3 size minimum:** 12 × 17 inches (30 × 43cm) for most projects
- **Gridded:** Helps with alignment

## Soft Cover Binding Tools

For pamphlets, zines, and flexible covers, you need minimal equipment:

### Basic Kit

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Needle | Sewing through signatures | Large eye, blunt tip preferred |
| Linen thread | Binding material | Waxed preferred |
| Awl | Piercing sewing holes | Sharp point, comfortable handle |
| Bone folder | Creasing and folding | See above |
| Ruler | Measuring | Cork-backed metal |
| Knife | Cutting | Fresh blades essential |

### Optional Additions

- **Punching cradle:** Holds signatures for piercing (can be DIY from cardboard)
- **Beeswax:** For waxing thread
- **Corner rounder:** For rounded cover corners

> **Tool swap:** Don't have an awl? A large needle or thumbtack works for thin stacks. A sturdy compass point also pierces cleanly.

## Hard Cover Binding Tools

Case binding and board attachment require additional equipment:

### Essential Additions

| Tool | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Binder's board | Cover material | 1/16–1/8 inch (2–3mm) thickness |
| PVA glue | Adhering materials | Archival quality essential |
| Glue brush | Applying adhesive | 1 inch (2.5cm) flat brushes work best |
| Pressing boards | Drying under pressure | Smooth, warp-resistant |
| Weights | Applying pressure | 10–20 lbs (5–10 kg) worth |
| Waste paper | Protecting work | Newsprint or scrap |

> **Budget option:** For weights, bricks wrapped in cloth work well. Clean, flat stones from a garden center are also effective.

### Measuring Tools

- **Dividers:** For transferring measurements accurately
- **Set square:** For checking right angles
- **Calipers:** For measuring spine width to 1/64 inch (0.5mm) accuracy

## Sewing-Specific Tools

Multi-signature sewing requires a few specialized items:

### Needles

- **Curved needles:** For kettle stitch and coptic binding
- **Straight needles:** For stab binding and simple sewing
- **Blunt tips:** Won't snag paper fibers

### Thread Options

- **Linen thread:** Traditional, strong, available in weights from 12/3 to 35/3
- **Bookbinding thread:** Pre-waxed, various thicknesses
- **Silk thread:** For fine work and exposed stitching

> **Common mistake:** Using cotton embroidery floss. It's too stretchy and weak for binding. Stick to linen or purpose-made thread.

### Sewing Frame (Optional)

For tape or cord sewing, a frame holds everything taut. Not essential for most beginner projects, but helpful for books with 10+ signatures.

## Cutting Tools

Beyond the basic craft knife:

### For Paper and Cloth

- **Rotary cutter:** Fast, straight cuts on fabric and paper
- **Scissors:** For cloth and thread only (never paper—it dulls them)
- **Board shears:** For high-volume work (expensive but efficient)

### For Board

- **Heavy-duty knife:** Stanley-type for 1/8 inch (3mm+) board
- **Multiple passes:** Never try to cut through thick board in one stroke

## Specialized Tools (Advanced)

These become important as skills develop:

| Tool | Used For |
|------|----------|
| Paring knife | Thinning leather edges |
| Backing hammer | Forming spine shoulders |
| Lying press | Holding books for edge work |
| Finishing tools | Gold and blind tooling |
| Sewing keys | Tensioning thread on frame |

## Building Your Kit

Start with the basics and add tools as projects demand them:

### Beginner (Pamphlets and Simple Bindings)

- Bone folder, ruler, knife, mat, needle, thread, awl

### Intermediate (Case Bindings)

- Add: pressing boards, weights, PVA glue, brushes, binder's board

### Advanced (Leather and Fine Binding)

- Add: paring knife, backing hammer, lying press, specialized finishing tools

## Where to Buy

- **Art supply stores:** Basic tools, some specialty items
- **Bookbinding suppliers:** Full range of professional tools (Talas, Hollander's)
- **Hardware stores:** Knives, rulers, weights
- **Online specialists:** Hard-to-find items

> **Pro tip:** Buy the best bone folder and knife you can afford—you'll use them constantly. Save money on weights and pressing boards with DIY alternatives.

## Care and Maintenance

- **Keep blades sharp:** Replace craft knife blades frequently
- **Clean brushes:** Wash glue brushes in water immediately after use
- **Store properly:** Bone folders can warp; store flat
- **Dry thoroughly:** Rust ruins metal tools

The right tools, properly maintained, will last a lifetime of bookbinding.

## Glossary

- **Bone folder:** A smooth, flat tool for creasing paper and burnishing surfaces
- **Awl:** A pointed tool for piercing sewing holes through paper
- **PVA:** Polyvinyl acetate, the standard white glue used in modern bookbinding
- **Binder's board:** Dense, stable cardboard used for hardcover book boards
- **Pressing boards:** Flat, rigid boards used to apply even pressure during drying

## FAQ

**What's the minimum I need to start bookbinding?**
A bone folder, metal ruler, craft knife, cutting mat, needle, and thread. With these six items, you can make pamphlets and simple bound books.

**Is it worth buying a sewing frame?**
For beginners, no. You can sew signatures without one. If you find yourself regularly making books with many signatures or doing tape/cord sewing, a frame makes the work easier.

**How often should I replace craft knife blades?**
Every 20–30 cuts on paper, or immediately when you notice tearing rather than clean cuts. Dull blades are more dangerous and give worse results.

**Can I use regular white glue instead of PVA?**
School glue works for practice but isn't archival. Bookbinding PVA is pH-neutral and remains flexible when dry, preventing cracking over time.

**What weight should pressing boards have?**
Aim for 10–20 lbs (5–10 kg) total. The pressure needs to be even across the book, so flat weights distributed across a pressing board work better than one heavy object.
