Before you can make a book, you need to understand how books are built. This guide covers every structural element from the inside out, giving you the vocabulary and understanding to tackle any binding project.

### The Text Block

The text block is the body of the book—all the pages gathered and bound together. It has its own anatomy:

#### Signatures (Sections)

A signature is a group of nested sheets folded together. Most books are made of multiple signatures sewn through their folds. Common signature sizes:

- **4-page (folio):** One sheet folded once
- **8-page (quarto):** One sheet folded twice
- **16-page (octavo):** One sheet folded three times

#### Head, Tail, and Fore Edge

- **Head:** The top edge of the book
- **Tail:** The bottom edge
- **Fore edge:** The front edge opposite the spine

These terms apply to both the text block and the finished book.

#### The Spine

The spine is where all signatures connect. In a sewn book, you'll see the stitching pattern here. The spine can be:

- **Flat:** Pages stack straight up
- **Rounded:** Pages fan out in a gentle curve
- **Backed:** Rounded with shoulders formed at the hinges

### The Case (Cover)

In hardcover books, the case is the rigid shell that protects the text block.

#### Boards

The front and back covers are made of binder's board—a dense, stable cardboard. Board thickness varies:

- **2mm:** Light books, journals
- **2.5mm:** Standard books
- **3mm+:** Large, heavy books

#### Spine Piece

The spine piece bridges the two boards. It can be:

- **Hollow:** A tube that doesn't touch the text block spine
- **Tight:** Adhered directly to the text block spine

Most modern case bindings use hollow backs for better opening.

#### Covering Material

The material wrapped around the boards:

- **Book cloth:** Woven fabric backed with paper
- **Buckram:** Heavily sized, durable cloth
- **Leather:** Full, half, or quarter coverage
- **Decorative paper:** Often used with cloth spine

### The Junction Points

Where the text block meets the case, several critical elements come together:

#### Squares

The squares are the overhang of the boards beyond the text block edges. Standard squares are 3mm on three sides (head, tail, fore edge). Squares protect the pages from damage.

      The part of the Board that
      visibly overlaps the Text Block
      is called the 'Square'.

      It protects the pages.

#### Hinges and Joints

These terms are often confused:

- **Hinge:** The flexible area between the board and spine piece (on the case)
- **Joint:** The groove where the text block shoulder meets the case

The hinge allows the cover to open; the joint is the visible line on the outside.

#### Turn-ins

The covering material folded over the board edges to the inside. Standard turn-in width is 15-20mm.

### The Endpapers

Endpapers connect the text block to the case and provide a finished interior.

#### Components

- **Paste-down:** The half adhered to the inside of the board
- **Flyleaf:** The free half that faces the first page of text

#### Types of Endpapers

- **Single folio:** One folded sheet, simple but weak
- **Made endpaper:** Multi-section construction for strength
- **Tipped-on:** Endpaper glued to the text block edge

### Decorative Elements

#### Headbands

Fabric bands at the head and tail of the spine. Originally structural (for pulling books off shelves), now mostly decorative.

- **Stuck-on:** Pre-made ribbon glued in place
- **Sewn:** Traditional, worked with thread around a core

#### Edge Decoration

The three edges of the text block can be:

- **Plain:** Untreated
- **Colored:** Sprayed or brushed with acrylic
- **Gilt:** Covered in gold leaf
- **Marbled:** Dipped in a marbling bath

### Putting It All Together

Here's how all the parts relate spatially:

```

│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │      PASTE-DOWN             │    │
│  │  ┌───────────────────────┐  │    │
│  │  │     FLYLEAF           │  │    │
│  │  │  ┌─────────────────┐  │  │    │
│  │  │  │   TEXT BLOCK    │  │  │    │
│  │  │  │                 │  │  │    │
│  │  │  └─────────────────┘  │  │    │
│  │  └───────────────────────┘  │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↑ SQUARES (overhang)
```

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy helps you:

1. **Diagnose problems:** If a book won't open flat, you know to check the spine construction
2. **Plan projects:** Know what materials you need before starting
3. **Communicate:** Use proper terms when seeking advice
4. **Appreciate craftsmanship:** Recognize quality in the books you encounter

Every book you make or repair becomes clearer once you can name and understand its parts.
