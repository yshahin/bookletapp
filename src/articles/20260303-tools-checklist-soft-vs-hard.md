The tools you need depend on what you're making. A simple pamphlet requires almost nothing; a full leather binding demands specialized equipment. This guide breaks down the essentials by binding type.

### Universal Tools (Always Needed)

These tools are used in virtually every binding project:

#### Bone Folder

A smooth, flat tool for creasing paper and rubbing down glued surfaces. Every bookbinder needs at least one.

- **Teflon folders:** Won't leave marks on dark paper
- **Traditional bone:** Classic choice, develops a patina

#### Metal Ruler

A straight edge for measuring and cutting. Steel is essential—plastic and wood get nicked by blades.

- **18-inch (45cm):** Good all-purpose size
- **Cork backing:** Prevents slipping

#### Craft Knife

For precision cutting. X-Acto style or Stanley knife both work.

- **Replace blades often:** Dull blades tear paper
- **Keep several handles:** One for heavy cuts, one for delicate work

#### Cutting Mat

Self-healing mats protect your work surface and blades.

- **A3 size minimum:** Large enough for most projects
- **Gridded:** Helps with alignment

### Soft Cover Binding Tools

For pamphlets, zines, and flexible covers, you need minimal equipment:

#### Basic Kit

| Tool | Purpose | Approximate Cost |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Needle | Sewing through signatures | Low |
| Linen thread | Strong, waxed preferred | Low |
| Awl | Piercing sewing holes | Low |
| Bone folder | Creasing and folding | Low |
| Ruler | Measuring | Low |
| Knife | Cutting | Low |

#### Optional Additions

- **Punching cradle:** Holds signatures for piercing (can be DIY)
- **Beeswax:** For waxing thread
- **Corner rounder:** For rounded cover corners

### Hard Cover Binding Tools

Case binding and board attachment require additional equipment:

#### Essential Additions

| Tool | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Binder's board | Cover material | Must be proper bookbinding board |
| PVA glue | Adhering materials | Archival quality essential |
| Glue brush | Applying adhesive | Flat brushes work best |
| Pressing boards | Drying under pressure | Smooth, warp-resistant |
| Weights | Applying pressure | 5-10 kg worth |
| Waste paper | Protecting work | Newsprint or scrap |

#### Measuring Tools

- **Dividers:** For transferring measurements
- **Set square:** For checking right angles
- **Calipers:** For measuring spine width accurately

### Sewing-Specific Tools

Multi-signature sewing requires a few specialized items:

#### Needles

- **Curved needles:** For kettle stitch and coptic binding
- **Straight needles:** For stab binding and simple sewing
- **Blunt tips:** Won't snag paper

#### Thread Options

- **Linen thread:** Traditional, strong, available in weights
- **Bookbinding thread:** Pre-waxed, various thicknesses
- **Silk thread:** For fine work and exposed stitching

#### Sewing Frame (Optional)

For tape or cord sewing, a frame holds everything taut. Not essential for most beginner projects.

### Cutting Tools

Beyond the basic craft knife:

#### For Paper and Cloth

- **Rotary cutter:** Fast, straight cuts
- **Scissors:** For cloth and thread
- **Board shears:** For high-volume work (expensive)

#### For Board

- **Heavy-duty knife:** Stanley-type for thick board
- **Multiple passes:** Don't try to cut through in one stroke

### Specialized Tools (Advanced)

These become important as skills develop:

| Tool | Used For |
|------|----------|
| Paring knife | Thinning leather edges |
| Backing hammer | Forming spine shoulders |
| Lying press | Holding books for edge work |
| Finishing tools | Gold and blind tooling |
| Sewing keys | Tensioning thread on frame |

### Building Your Kit

Start with the basics and add tools as projects demand them:

#### Beginner (Pamphlets and Simple Bindings)
Investment: Low
- Bone folder, ruler, knife, mat, needle, thread, awl

#### Intermediate (Case Bindings)
Investment: Moderate
- Add: pressing boards, weights, glue, brushes, board

#### Advanced (Leather and Fine Binding)
Investment: Higher
- Add: paring knife, backing hammer, lying press, specialized equipment

### Where to Buy

- **Art supply stores:** Basic tools, some specialty items
- **Bookbinding suppliers:** Full range of professional tools
- **Hardware stores:** Knives, rulers, weights
- **Online specialists:** Hard-to-find items

### Care and Maintenance

- **Keep blades sharp:** Replace craft knife blades frequently
- **Clean brushes:** Wash glue brushes immediately after use
- **Store properly:** Bone folders can warp; store flat
- **Dry thoroughly:** Rust ruins metal tools

The right tools, properly maintained, will last a lifetime of bookbinding.
