Every bookbinder must understand adhesives. The two workhorses of the craft are PVA (polyvinyl acetate) and wheat paste. Each has distinct properties, and knowing when to use which will dramatically improve your bindings.

### PVA: The Modern Standard

PVA is a synthetic polymer adhesive—the white glue you probably already know. In bookbinding, we use archival-quality PVA, which is pH-neutral and won't yellow or become brittle over time.

#### Properties of PVA

- **Dries quickly:** Sets in minutes, fully cures in hours
- **Dries clear:** Becomes transparent when dry
- **Flexible when dry:** Won't crack with book movement
- **Strong bond:** Creates a permanent, non-reversible bond
- **Waterproof when cured:** Resistant to moisture

#### Best Uses for PVA

- Gluing spine linings
- Attaching endpapers
- Adhering book cloth to boards
- Any application requiring quick setting time
- Projects where reversibility isn't needed

### Wheat Paste: The Traditional Choice

Wheat paste (also called wheat starch paste) is made by cooking wheat starch in water. It's been used for centuries and remains essential for conservation work.

#### Properties of Wheat Paste

- **Slow drying:** Gives you extended working time
- **Reversible:** Can be reactivated with water
- **Minimal warping:** High water content but dries without distortion
- **Archival:** Completely stable over centuries
- **Adjustable consistency:** Can be thinned or thickened as needed

#### Best Uses for Wheat Paste

- Leather paring and turn-ins
- Paper repairs and conservation
- Lining fragile materials
- Any work requiring repositioning
- Historical restoration where reversibility is essential

### The Chemistry Explained

#### Why PVA Bonds Permanently

PVA works through mechanical adhesion. As the water in PVA evaporates, the polymer chains physically interlock with the paper fibers. Once dry, these chains are locked together permanently. Adding water won't reverse this—you'd need solvents to break the bonds.

#### Why Wheat Paste is Reversible

Wheat paste bonds through hydrogen bonding between starch molecules and cellulose fibers. These bonds are strong but can be broken by reintroducing water, which allows the starch to re-swell and release from the paper fibers.

### Mixing Adhesives: The Hybrid Approach

Many bookbinders mix PVA and wheat paste to get properties of both:

| Ratio (PVA : Paste) | Properties | Use Case |
|---------------------|------------|----------|
| 1:1 | Balanced working time and strength | General purpose work |
| 1:3 | Extended working time, some permanence | Leather work |
| 3:1 | Quick tack with slight repositioning | Cover work |

### Practical Tips

#### Working with PVA

1. Apply in thin, even coats—thick layers wrinkle paper
2. Work quickly once applied
3. Keep a damp sponge nearby to wipe excess
4. Store with lid tight; it skins over rapidly

#### Working with Wheat Paste

1. Cook thoroughly—undercooked paste is weak
2. Strain through a sieve to remove lumps
3. Apply with a brush in consistent strokes
4. Make fresh batches; refrigerated paste lasts only a few days

### Which Should You Use?

**Choose PVA when:**

- Speed matters
- You need a permanent bond
- Working with book cloth or cover materials
- Building new books

**Choose Wheat Paste when:**

- Working with delicate papers
- Doing conservation or repair
- You need time to adjust positioning
- Working with leather

### Common Mistakes

- **Too much PVA:** Creates waves and wrinkles in paper
- **Undercooked paste:** Results in weak, chalky bonds
- **Wrong adhesive for the job:** Using PVA on antique repairs destroys reversibility

Understanding adhesives is understanding bookbinding itself. The right glue, applied correctly, is invisible in the finished work.
