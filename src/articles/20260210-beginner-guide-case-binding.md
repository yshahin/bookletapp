Case binding is the standard method for creating hardcover books. Unlike other binding methods where the cover attaches directly to the pages, case binding creates the cover (the "case") separately from the text block, then joins them together. This separation is the key to understanding how hardcover books work.

### Understanding the Two Components

A case-bound book has two main parts:

#### The Text Block

This is the book's interior—all the pages sewn or glued together. The text block is complete before you even start making the cover. It has its own spine, endpapers, and structure.

#### The Case

The case is the hardcover shell. It consists of two boards (front and back covers) and a spine piece, all wrapped in covering material like book cloth or paper. The case is built flat, then attached to the text block.

### Materials Needed

- **Binder's board** (2-3mm thick greyboard or davey board)
- **Book cloth or decorative paper**
- **PVA glue**
- **Text weight paper** for pages (80-100 gsm)
- **Endpaper stock** (slightly heavier than text pages)
- **Bone folder**
- **Metal ruler and craft knife**
- **Pressing boards and weights**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Text Block

Before making the case, your text block must be complete:

1. Fold your paper into signatures (groups of nested sheets)
2. Sew the signatures together using a kettle stitch or similar method
3. Glue the spine with PVA and let it dry
4. Attach endpapers to the first and last signatures

The text block should be pressed flat and the spine should be firm but flexible.

### Step 2: Measure for the Case

Accurate measurement is critical. You need three dimensions:

- **Height:** Text block height plus 6mm (3mm overhang top and bottom)
- **Width:** Text block width plus 3mm (for the square—the overhang at the fore edge)
- **Spine width:** Measured with calipers while the text block is pressed

### Step 3: Cut the Boards

Cut two cover boards to the height and width you calculated. Cut the spine piece to the same height, but only as wide as your spine measurement.

**Important:** Always cut boards with the grain running head to tail (parallel to the spine). This prevents warping.

### Step 4: Build the Case

1. Cut your covering material 20mm larger than the total spread of your boards
2. Lay out the boards on the covering material with even gaps between them (about 6-8mm between each board and the spine piece)
3. Glue the covering material using PVA
4. Turn in the edges, starting with the top and bottom, then the sides
5. Rub down firmly with a bone folder

Let the case dry under weight for at least an hour.

### Step 5: Case In (Attaching the Text Block)

This is where the two components become one book:

1. Apply PVA evenly across the entire surface of the first endpaper
2. Position the text block on the front board, ensuring even squares on all sides
3. Close the cover and flip the book over
4. Repeat with the back endpaper
5. Place the book between pressing boards and add weight

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Uneven squares:** Measure twice, cut once. The overhang should be consistent on all three edges
- **Wet text block:** If glue soaks through the endpaper, you've used too much
- **Warped boards:** Always check grain direction before cutting
- **Gaps at the hinge:** The space between board and spine piece must accommodate the text block's shoulder

### Practice Project

Start with a simple single-signature notebook to understand the process before attempting a full sewn text block. Use lightweight materials and accept that your first few attempts are learning experiences.

Case binding becomes intuitive with practice. Once you understand that the cover and text block are independent units that come together at the end, the entire process makes sense.
