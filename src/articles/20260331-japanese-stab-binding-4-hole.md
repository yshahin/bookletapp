Japanese stab binding (Stab binding or Stabstitch) refers to a family of side-sewn bindings where thread passes through holes along the spine edge. The 4-hole pattern, called **Yotsume Toji** (四つ目綴じ), is the foundation of all Japanese stab bindings and the perfect starting point.

### History and Characteristics

Stab binding originated in China and spread throughout East Asia. Unlike Western bindings that sew through the fold, stab binding sews through stacked flat pages near the spine edge.

**Key characteristics:**

- Pages don't open flat (limited opening angle)
- Single-sided printing only (or accepts minor show-through)
- Decorative, exposed stitching
- No adhesives required
- Simple materials: just paper, thread, needle

### Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Text paper | 20-30 sheets | Medium weight, grain parallel to spine |
| Cover paper | 2 sheets | Heavier stock, same grain direction |
| Thread | 4× spine length | Silk, linen, or embroidery floss |
| Needle | 1 | Sharp, large eye |
| Awl | 1 | For piercing holes |
| Bone folder | 1 | For creasing corners |
| Ruler | 1 | For measuring |
| Pencil | 1 | For marking |
| Clips | 4-6 | Binder clips to hold pages |

### Step 1: Prepare the Pages

1. **Cut all pages to the same size** (e.g., A5 or 6"×9")
2. **Check grain direction**—grain must run parallel to the spine
3. **Stack pages neatly** with covers on top and bottom
4. **Tap edges on table** to align perfectly
5. **Clip the fore edge** to hold everything together

### Step 2: Mark the Holes

Japanese stab binding uses specific proportions. For a standard 4-hole pattern:

**Spine margin:** The distance from the edge to the holes—typically 10-15mm

**Hole spacing:** Divide the remaining spine length into equal sections

**Standard layout:**

1. Mark a line parallel to the spine at your chosen margin (e.g., 12mm from edge)
2. Measure the spine height
3. Mark the first hole 15mm from the head
4. Mark the fourth hole 15mm from the tail
5. Divide the remaining space into three equal parts for holes 2 and 3

```
HEAD
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ •  ← Hole 1 (15mm from top)
  │    │
  │ •  ← Hole 2
  │    │ (equal spacing)
  │ •  ← Hole 3
  │    │
  │ •  ← Hole 4 (15mm from bottom)
  └─────────────────────┘
TAIL
  ↑
  12mm from spine edge
```

### Step 3: Pierce the Holes

1. Place the book block on a soft surface (cardboard, magazine)
2. Hold firmly with clips still attached
3. Use the awl to pierce straight through at each marked point
4. Push from front to back
5. Wiggle slightly to widen holes for the needle

**Tip:** Punching on scrap cardboard gives cleaner exit holes.

### Step 4: Thread the Needle

Cut thread approximately **4 times the spine length**:
- If spine is 20cm, cut 80cm of thread
- Thread the needle
- Do **not** knot the end—leave a tail for tying

### Step 5: The 4-Hole Sewing Pattern

The Yotsume Toji pattern wraps thread around the spine and through each hole systematically.

**Starting position:** Begin at Hole 1, entering from the back

#### The Sewing Sequence

**Part 1: Initial pass (back to front)**

1. Enter **Hole 1** from back, leaving a 10cm tail
2. Wrap around the **head edge** and re-enter **Hole 1** from back
3. Exit **Hole 2** (front)
4. Enter **Hole 3** from front
5. Exit **Hole 4** (back)
6. Wrap around the **tail edge** and re-enter **Hole 4** from back
7. Exit **Hole 4** (front)

**Part 2: Return pass (front to back)**

8. Enter **Hole 3** from front
9. Exit **Hole 2** (back)
10. Enter **Hole 1** from back
11. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 1
12. Enter **Hole 2** from front
13. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 2
14. Enter **Hole 3** from back
15. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 3
16. Enter **Hole 4** from front
17. Wrap around the **spine edge** at Hole 4
18. Enter **Hole 3** from back

**Finishing:**

19. Exit **Hole 3** next to the starting tail
20. Tie a square knot with both thread ends
21. Trim tails to about 5mm
22. Tuck knot under a stitch to hide

### What the Pattern Looks Like

**Front cover:**
- Vertical stitches connecting all four holes
- Corner wraps at head and tail

**Spine edge:**
- Individual horizontal wraps at each hole

**Back cover:**
- Diagonal stitches creating an X pattern between holes

### Common Mistakes and Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Loose stitches | Not enough tension | Pull snug after each pass |
| Thread tangling | Too long | Use shorter thread, multiple lengths |
| Uneven holes | Inconsistent awl angle | Pierce straight through |
| Pages shifting | Not clipped properly | Use more clips during sewing |
| Can't find hole | Lost track of pattern | Mark holes with numbers |

### Variations to Explore

Once you've mastered the 4-hole pattern, try these variations:

#### Tortoise Shell (Kikko Toji)

A 6-hole pattern that creates a decorative zigzag effect.

#### Hemp Leaf (Asa no Ha Toji)

Complex pattern resembling hemp leaves—advanced but stunning.

#### Noble (Koki Toji)

Adds extra wrapping for a more elaborate spine.

### Design Considerations

**Thread color:**
- Contrasting thread makes stitching a design feature
- Matching thread creates a subtle, elegant look
- Variegated thread adds visual interest

**Paper choice:**
- Thinner paper = more pages possible
- Japanese papers (washi) are traditional but not required
- Maximum practical thickness: about 30 sheets

**Cover materials:**
- Decorative paper
- Book cloth
- Leather (pierce carefully)
- Traditional Japanese covers: often patterned paper

### Practical Uses

Japanese stab bindings work well for:

- Photo albums (single-sided inserts)
- Guest books
- Sketchbooks
- Menus or catalogs
- Art portfolios
- Journals (accept limited opening)

### Care for Stab-Bound Books

- Store upright or flat—not leaning
- Handle by the boards, not the thread
- The spine is decorative—avoid catching threads

The 4-hole Yotsume Toji is your gateway to Japanese bookbinding. Master this pattern, and the more complex variations become simple extensions of the same logic.
