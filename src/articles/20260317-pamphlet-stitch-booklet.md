The pamphlet stitch is the simplest form of bookbinding. With just paper, thread, and a needle, you can create a functional notebook. This project teaches fundamental skills that apply to every binding method.

### What You'll Make

A 16-page (8-leaf) soft cover notebook, approximately A5 size, with a three-hole pamphlet stitch binding. Perfect for notes, sketches, or as a gift.

### Materials Needed

| Material | Quantity | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Text weight paper | 4 sheets | A4 size, 80-100 gsm |
| Cover stock | 1 sheet | A4 size, 160-200 gsm |
| Linen thread | 50 cm | Waxed preferred |
| Needle | 1 | Large eye, sharp point |
| Bone folder | 1 | For creasing |
| Awl | 1 | For piercing holes |
| Ruler | 1 | For measuring |
| Pencil | 1 | For marking |

### Step 1: Prepare the Text Pages

Take your four sheets of text paper:

1. Stack them precisely, edges aligned
2. Fold the stack in half, bringing the short edges together
3. Crease firmly with the bone folder
4. This creates your **signature**—a nested set of folded pages

You now have 16 pages (4 sheets × 2 sides × 2 leaves per fold = 16 pages).

### Step 2: Prepare the Cover

Take the cover stock:

1. Fold it in half the same way as the text pages
2. Crease firmly
3. The cover will wrap around your signature

**Optional:** Trim the cover slightly larger than the text pages (2-3mm on head, tail, and fore edge) for a professional look.

### Step 3: Mark the Sewing Stations

Open the cover and text block flat. You'll mark three holes along the fold:

1. **Center hole:** Find the exact middle of the spine
2. **Head hole:** 2-3 cm from the top edge
3. **Tail hole:** 2-3 cm from the bottom edge

Mark with a pencil on the inside of the fold. Ensure marks are on the fold line itself.

```
HEAD EDGE
    •  ← Head hole (2-3 cm from edge)
    |
    |
    •  ← Center hole (exact middle)
    |
    |
    •  ← Tail hole (2-3 cm from edge)
TAIL EDGE
```

### Step 4: Pierce the Holes

Place the text block inside the cover:

1. Open to the center fold
2. Rest the spine on a soft surface (magazine or cardboard)
3. Use the awl to pierce through all layers at each mark
4. Push the awl from the inside out
5. Wiggle slightly to enlarge the hole for the needle

Pierce all three holes through both the cover and text pages simultaneously.

### Step 5: Thread the Needle

Cut approximately 50 cm of thread:

1. Thread the needle
2. Do **not** knot the end—you need both tails free

If using unwaxed thread, run it over beeswax now for smoother sewing.

### Step 6: The Pamphlet Stitch

This is a three-hole stitch. Work from inside the signature:

**Starting from inside:**

1. Enter the **center hole** from inside, pulling thread through until about 10 cm remains inside
2. Exit through the center hole, leaving the tail inside

**Sewing pattern:**

3. Enter the **tail hole** from outside
4. Exit through the **head hole** from inside
5. Enter the **center hole** from outside

**Finishing:**

6. Your thread should now exit next to the starting tail
7. Make sure the thread wraps around the long stitch connecting head to tail holes
8. Tie a square knot with the two thread ends

### Step 7: Trim and Finish

With the stitch complete:

1. Trim thread tails to about 1 cm
2. Close the book and press under weight for 10-15 minutes
3. If desired, trim the fore edge for a cleaner look

### The Completed Stitch Pattern

When done correctly, you should see:

**Outside spine:**

- One long stitch from head hole to tail hole
- One short stitch crossing the center

**Inside spine:**

- Two diagonal stitches meeting at center
- A knot at the center hole

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pages falling out | Thread too loose | Pull snug before knotting |
| Cover won't close flat | Holes not aligned | Repierce through all layers together |
| Thread breaks | Over-tensioned | Use waxed thread, pull gently |
| Spine puckers | Thread too tight | Maintain even, moderate tension |

### Variations to Try

Once you've mastered the basic three-hole pamphlet:

#### Five-Hole Pamphlet

Add two more holes between the center and end holes. The pattern is longer but follows the same logic.

#### Decorative Stitch

Use colored thread for a visible design element. Try contrasting colors or variegated thread.

#### Multiple Signatures

Stack 2-3 signatures together (nest them or sew separately), and you have a thicker notebook.

### What You've Learned

This simple project teaches skills used in all bookbinding:

- **Folding accurately:** Creating clean signatures
- **Piercing holes:** Consistent, aligned stations
- **Sewing tension:** Not too tight, not too loose
- **Finishing:** Trimming and pressing

### Next Steps

Ready for more? Try:

- Adding more pages with additional signatures
- Using the pamphlet stitch for cards or invitations
- Experimenting with different cover materials
- Moving on to multi-signature bindings with kettle stitch

The pamphlet stitch is the foundation. Every complex binding builds on these basic principles of folding, piercing, and sewing.
